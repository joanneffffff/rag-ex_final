We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. In addition, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the provisions of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective method. We recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to receivables of $7.6 million, an increase to inventories of $2.8 million, an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.9 million, an increase to other accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of $0.2 million. The adjustments primarily related to the timing of recognition of certain customer charges, trade promotional expenditures, and volume discounts.",

Included in the balance at May 26, 2019 are $1.0 million of tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. Because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period. Any associated interest and penalties imposed would affect the tax rate. As of May 27, 2018, our gross liability for unrecognized tax benefits was $32.5 million, excluding a related liability of $7.7 million for gross interest and penalties. Interest and penalties recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations was an expense of $1.2 million in fiscal 2019, an expense of $1.6 million in fiscal 2018, and a benefit of $0.3 million in fiscal 2017.",

A provision for impairment of trade receivables is raised when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments (more than 60 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate.

Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to a customer (“transaction price”). The Company will then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When determining the transaction price of the contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. None of the Company’s licenses and collaboration agreements contained a significant financing component at either December 31, 2019 or 2018.",

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.",

The decrease was primarily driven by a reduction in the number of global services and cloud infrastructure personnel, which led to a decrease of $2.2 million in compensation and benefits expense, including stock-based compensation expense, as compared to 2018. This reduction in headcount also contributed to a decrease in allocated facilities and information technology costs of $0.5 million in 2019. We also experienced a decrease of $0.9 million in hosting costs in 2019, due to a decline in the usage of our hosted platform as compared to 2018.

Sales of DRAM products for 2019 decreased 28% as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately 30% resulting from supply and demand imbalances, customer inventory corrections, and CPU shortages. Sales of NAND products for 2019 decreased 12% as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices in the mid-40% range resulting from supply and demand imbalances, which were partially offset by significant increases in sales volumes. In addition, demand for our NAND products was adversely affected by the transition from SATA SSDs to NVMe SSDs. The higher NAND sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of high-value mobile managed NAND products as well as discrete NAND products enabled by our execution in ramping 64- and 96-layer TLC 3D NAND.",

In May 2019, a major shareholder sold its shareholding which triggered a re-assessment of the carrying value of our investment in OLT-O. This resulted in an impairment charge of $7.3 million for the write down of the carrying value in our investment in OLT-O in the year ended December 31, 2019.",

The ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019 will not be realizable. Accordingly, management has maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 was an increase of $1,816.",
