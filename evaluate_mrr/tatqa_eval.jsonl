Some of these limitations are: (a) although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized may have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect cash capital expenditure requirements for such replacements or for new capital expenditure requirements; (b) Adjusted EBITDA does not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our working capital needs; (c) Adjusted EBITDA does  may represent a reduction in cash available to us; and (e) other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate Adjusted EBITDA or similarly titled measures differently, which reduces its usefulness as a comparative measure.\nBecause of these and other limitations, you should consider Adjusted EBITDA alongside our other GAAP-based financial performance measures, our net income and our other GAAP financial results. The following table presents a reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for each of the periods indicated (in thousands).", "answer": "16.36"}

{"question": "What percentage of the decrease in total revenue is from the loss in Zyla (Oxaydo)?", "context": "NOTE 4 – REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nRevenue is recognized when, or as, performance obligations under terms of a contract are satisfied, which occurs when control of the promised service is transferred to a customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring services to a customer (“transaction price”). The Company will then recognize as revenue the amount of the transaction price that is allocated to the respective performance obligation when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When determining the transaction price of the contract, an adjustment is made if payment from a customer occurs either significantly before or significantly after performance, resulting in a significant financing component. None of the Company’s licenses and collaboration agreements contained a significant financing component at either December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nThe Company’s existing license and collaboration agreements may contain a single performance obligation or may contain multiple performance obligations. Those which contain multiple performance obligations will require an allocation of the transaction price based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised services underlying each performance obligation.\nThe Company’s existing license and collaboration agreements contain customer options for the license of additional products and territories. We determined the option’s standalone selling prices based on the option product’s potential market size in the option territory as compared to the currently licensed product and U.S. territory. Some of our existing license and collaboration agreements contain a license to the technology as well as licenses to tradenames or trademarks.

The increase in sales was primarily driven by growth in both organic and inorganic business in North America. Sales in 2019 were higher in the U.S. primarily due to system development on contracts in New York, Boston, and the San Francisco Bay Area. Businesses acquired by CTS during fiscal year 2019, whose operations are all located in the U.S., had sales of $74.4 million in fiscal year 2019. Sales increased slightly in Australia between fiscal years 2018 and 2019 as increased system development work on a contract in Brisbane was partially offset by the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates as well as a decrease in service sales. Sales were lower in the UK primarily due to a decrease in system development work in London and the negative impact of currency exchange rates. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currencies in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS sales of $22.2 million for 2019 compared to 2018, primarily due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and Australian dollar.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangibles: Amortization of purchased intangibles included in the CTS operating results totaled $22.0 million in 2019 and $5.2 million in 2018. The increase is due to the amortization of purchased intangibles for companies acquired by CTS in fiscal year 2019.\nOperating Income: CTS operating income increased 28% in 2019 to $77.2 million compared to $60.4 million in 2018. The increase in operating income was primarily caused by higher margins on increased work on development projects in New York, Boston, the San Francisco Bay Area and Brisbane, as well as the impact of the adoption of ASC 606. These increases in operating income were partially offset by operating losses incurred by businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal 2019 as well as the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Businesses acquired by CTS in fiscal years 2019 incurred operating losses of $10.1 million in fiscal 2019, which included acquisition transaction costs of $8.1 million and amortization of intangible assets totaling $19.3 million. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar resulted in a decrease in CTS operating income of $3.6 million for 2019 compared to 2018.\nAdjusted EBITDA: CTS Adjusted EBITDA increased 51% to $110.5 million in 2019 compared to $73.3 million in 2018. The increase in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the same factors that drove the increase in operating income described above excluding the increases in amortization of purchased intangibles and acquisition transaction costs which are excluded from Adjusted EBITDA.

At December 31, 2019, there were $0.0 of outstanding borrowings under the 2016 Facility.\nThe 2016 Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit Roper’s ability to incur new debt, enter into certain mergers and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change its line of business.

The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.50 to 1.\nThe 2016 Facility provides that the consolidated total leverage ratio may be increased, no more than twice during the term of the 2016 Facility, to 4.00 to 1 for a consecutive four quarter fiscal period per increase (or, for any portion of such four quarter fiscal period in which the maximum would be 4.25 to 1). In conjunction with the Deltek acquisition in December of 2016, we increased the maximum consolidated total leverage ratio covenant to 4.25 to 1 through June 30, 2017 and 4.00 to 1 through December 31, 2017.\nThe Company was in compliance with its debt covenants throughout the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018.\nOn August 26, 2019, the Company completed a public offering of $500.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.35% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2024 and $700.0 aggregate principal amount of 2.95% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2029 (the “2019 Offering”).

The application of the standard did not result in a significant change to the recognition of revenue compared to the previous accounting policy for revenue.\nAltium has one performance obligation for each of the revenue streams listed below and has applied the following revenue recognition methods:\n1. Software licenses: Revenue is recognised at a point in time when license activation is available to the user. 2. Subscription and maintenance: Revenue is deferred and is subsequently recognised over the period in which the subscription service is provided. As the billing structure for customers is often bundled with licenses and billed on activation, there is an allocation methodology applied based on stand-alone selling prices to calculate the portion of revenue to be deferred. 3. Search advertising: Revenue is recognised at a point in time on a price-per-click basis, this is when a user engages with the search result on the website by clicking on it. 4. Services revenue: Revenue from providing services is recognised over the period in which the services are rendered. Services include training and implementation services. 5. Other revenue - Royalties: Royalties related to IP are recognised at a point in time when the subsequent sales occurs. 6. Interest income: Revenue is recognised on a time proportion basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to the assets net carrying amount.\nImpact on opening retained profits\nFor incremental costs incurred in obtaining a contract, such as sales commissions, Altium has chosen to apply the practical expedient available under the standard which permits immediate expensing when the underlying asset is amortised in one year or less, given subscription periods are typically for a 12 month period.\nWhere revenue is deferred for more than 12 months and an upfront commission has been paid, the commission is capitalised and amortised over the period the revenue is recognised.

We elected to pay the one-time transition tax over a period of up to eight years.\nIn conjunction with the Tax Act, the SEC issued guidance under Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (‘‘SAB 118’’) directing taxpayers to record the impact of the Tax Act as ‘‘provisional’’ when they do not have all the necessary information to complete the accounting under ASC 740. The guidance allowed for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date of the Tax Act to finalize the recording of the related tax impact. In accordance with SAB 118, we recorded provisional estimates to our consolidated financial statements in fiscal 2018 based on the Tax Act. During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we further analyzed the income tax effects of the Tax Act and determined there were no material changes to the provisional amounts disclosed in our fiscal 2018 financial statements. Although our accounting for the effects of the Tax Act is complete under SAB 118, there may be future adjustments based on interpretations by the U.S. federal and state governments and regulatory organizations, legislative updates or new regulations, or changes in accounting standards for income taxes.\nThe Tax Act also includes provisions for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (‘‘GILTI’’) wherein taxes on foreign income are imposed in excess of a deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. In general, this income will effectively be taxed at a 10.5% tax rate reduced by any available current year foreign tax credits. This provision became effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, which was our fiscal 2019. We have elected to treat tax generated by the GILTI provisions as a period expense.\nThe effective tax rate on income from continuing operations before income taxes for fiscal 2019 of 10.4% was lower than the U.S. federal tax rate of 21.0% primarily due to the tax benefit from losses of our German subsidiaries, which are subject to higher tax rates than U.S. tax rates, adjustments related to the Tax Act’s transition tax, the net excess tax benefits from restricted stock unit vesting, the benefit of federal research and development tax credits and our Singapore and South Korea tax exemptions.

This decrease reflected lower volume of GPS samples sequenced and recognized as revenue in the current year resulting from deliveries for patients covered by contract and non-contracted payers. Currently, we recognize revenue from clients with executed contracts, and from clients without a contractual agreement where we recognize revenue on a cash basis given the uncertainty over reimbursement.

Our software and hardware related revenue results experience fluctuations due to the timing of implementation completions for our DCX customers and our revenue recognition for those arrangements.\nMaintenance revenue increased $0.7 million, or 7.0%, from $9.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2018 to $10.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This increase was due to the timing of DCX customer contracts and post contract support maintenance services completed and recognized in the current year period.\nSequencing and molecular analysis revenue decreased $1.4 million, or 44.6% from $3.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018 to $1.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease reflected lower volume of GPS samples sequenced and recognized as revenue in the current year resulting from deliveries for patients covered by contract and non-contracted payers. Currently, we recognize revenue from clients with executed contracts, and from clients without a contractual agreement where we recognize revenue on a cash basis given the uncertainty over reimbursement. As we gain additional insurance coverage, including coverage under government insurance programs, we expect to be able to reduce the portion of sequencing and molecular analysis revenue which is recognized on a cash basis.\nWe continue to focus efforts to enhance reimbursement from plans when profiles are ordered and there is no payer contract in place. We are actively engaging plans with detail which supports a physician’s reason for ordering. Our utilization of pre-authorizations and supporting documentation assists in the overall billing and appeal process, optimizing payment with payers, who do not have a formal agreement with us.\nIn parallel with the private payer activities described above, we are also making extensive efforts to explore approval pathways for our test capabilities (including the FDA in-vitro medical device clearance we received in November 2019), which we believe will facilitate coverage from governmental programs such as Medicare. Those activities are ongoing but have uncertainty on the timelines as to formal approval. Lastly, we have implemented an increase in the patient financial responsibility which is collected prior to testing to ensure that at least a partial payment is received for every test performed, we expect unpaid and partial paid orders to decline, which will likely result in a decline in total GPS orders and revenue in the short-term.\nHome health care services revenue decreased $3.5 million, or 54.7%, from $6.3 million in 2018 to $2.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. This decrease was due to the sale of our home health care services business in June 2019.\nWe believe that significant opportunities exist for expanded cross-selling across our products and across our existing customer base, including Eviti and NaviNet customer bases. We also believe that our customer base and our product solutions provide unique opportunities to expand the volume of GPS Cancer analysis reporting to our customer base. Maintaining our current customer base will be important to our future SaaS recurring revenue streams.", "answer": "11.51"}

Lease receivables include sales-type and direct-financing leases. Arrangements related to leases are generally collateralized by a security interest in the underlying assets. Our loan receivables include customer financing for purchases of our hardware, software and services and also may include additional funds for other costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services. We also provide financing to certain qualified customers for long-term service contracts, which primarily relate to technical support services. The majority of the revenue from these financed service contracts is deferred and is recognized ratably over the period during which the services are performed. Financing receivables increased by 2%. We expect to continue to expand the use of our financing programs in the near term.\nFinancing Guarantees In the normal course of business, third parties may provide financing arrangements to our customers and channel partners under financing programs. The financing arrangements to customers provided by third parties are related to leases and loans and typically have terms of up to three years. In some cases, we provide guarantees to third parties for these lease and loan arrangements. The financing arrangements to channel partners consist of revolving short-term financing provided by third parties, generally with payment terms ranging from 60 to 90 days. In certain instances, these financing arrangements result in a transfer of our receivables to the third party. The receivables are derecognized upon transfer, as these transfers qualify as true sales, and we receive payments for the receivables from the third party based on our standard payment terms.\nThe volume of channel partner financing was $29.6 billion, $28.2 billion, and $27.0 billion in fiscal 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

However, the tax rate may fluctuate if business changes are implemented in response to legislation arising from the OECD’s Base Erosion & Profit Shifting Project. Legislative change in key territories is being monitored and acted upon.\nThe Group does not anticipate any significant impact on the future tax charge, liabilities or assets, as a result of the triggering of Article 50(2) of the Treaty on European Union, but cannot rule out the possibility that, for example, a failure to reach satisfactory arrangements for the UK’s future relationship with the European Union, could have an impact on such matters.\nThe European Commission has concluded its investigation into the UK’s controlled foreign company (“CFC”) rules. The CFC rules levy a charge on foreign entities controlled by the UK that are subject to a lower rate of tax, however there is currently an exemption available for 75% of this charge if the activities being undertaken by the CFC relate to financing. The EC concluded that this exemption is in breach of EU State Aid rules. However, whilst we are awaiting further detail from HMRC, the position has not changed from a tax accounting perspective. The risk is possible, but not probable. UK ministers have yet to decide on whether to pursue an appeal. No provision for this potential liability of $3.6M has been provided in these Consolidated Financial Statements as it is not clear what, if any, the ultimate financial result will be.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are attributable to the following:\nAs at 31 March 2019 the aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with undistributed earnings of subsidiaries for which deferred tax liabilities have been recognised was $Nil (2018: $Nil). No liability has been recognised because the Group is in a position to control the reversal of temporary differences and it is probable that such differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date.", "answer": "2.25"}
{"question": "Which model is used for estimating the fair value of SSARs?", "context": "Stock-Settled Stock Appreciation Rights\nStock-Settled Appreciation Rights (“SSARs”) are rights granted to an employee to receive value equal to the difference in the price of our common shares on the date of the grant and on the date of exercise.

Sales of DRAM products for 2019 decreased 28% as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices of approximately 30% resulting from supply and demand imbalances, customer inventory corrections, and CPU shortages. Sales of NAND products for 2019 decreased 12% as compared to 2018 primarily due to declines in average selling prices in the mid-40% range resulting from supply and demand imbalances, which were partially offset by significant increases in sales volumes. In addition, demand for our NAND products was adversely affected by the transition from SATA SSDs to NVMe SSDs. The higher NAND sales volumes in 2019 were driven by increases in sales of high-value mobile managed NAND products as well as discrete NAND products enabled by our execution in ramping 64- and 96-layer TLC 3D NAND.\nTotal revenue for 2018 increased 50% as compared to 2017. Higher revenue in 2018 for both DRAM and NAND as compared to 2017 were driven by strong execution in delivering high-value products featuring our 1Xnm DRAM and 64-layer 3D NAND technologies combined with strong demand for products across our primary markets.

Failure to satisfy any of these covenants will constitute a default under the terms of the credit agreement. Further, dividends are restricted to the Company’s current dividend policy of one-third of the Company’s net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Company is allowed to repurchase up to $75.0 million of its capital stock in any year provided there is no default under the credit agreement and the Company has availability of at least $20.0 million under the facility.\nThe credit agreement for the Revolving Credit Facility also includes customary events of default and customary remedies upon the occurrence of an event of default, including acceleration of the amounts due and foreclosure of the collateral.\nAt June 1, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenant requirements of all loan agreements.", "answer": "(i) a minimum working capital ratio of 2.00 to 1.00 and (ii) an annual limit on capital expenditures of $100.0 million"}
