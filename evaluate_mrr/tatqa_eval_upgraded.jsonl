During the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recorded tax expense of $23.0 million in continuing operations related to the write-off of deferred tax assets for which the underlying assets and liabilities related to Arlo. The decrease in the effective tax rate and the decrease in tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2018, compared to the year ended December 31, 2017, resulted primarily from the combination of a decline in pre-tax earnings and the decrease in the US federal tax rate from 35% to 21%, and the impact of other provisions of the tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Additionally, tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 included the effect of the implementation of certain aspects of the Tax Act including recording provisional expense for the transition tax of $21.7 million for US federal and state income tax purposes. Additionally, the Company recorded tax expense of $26.6 million resulting from the remeasurement of net deferred tax assets resulting from the reduction in US federal tax rate. These items resulted in higher tax expense during fiscal 2017. During fiscal year 2018, the Company completed the computation of the transition tax as part of the 2017 income tax returns filing and reduced the federal and state provisional amount by $6.7 million. The Company has also evaluated the impact of the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income “GILTI”, Foreign Derived Intangible Income “FDII” and Base Erosion and Anti-abuse Tax “BEAT” provisions and as a result recorded a detriment of $0.4 million and a benefit of $(0.7) million in relation to GILTI and FDII respectively, resulting on a net benefit of $(0.3) million.

{"query": "What are the impacts of significant revisions in contract estimates?", "context": "Use of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements.

For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million.
