In its opinion, the U.S. Tax Court accepted Altera’s position of excluding stock-based compensation from its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. In June 2019, the Ninth Circuit, through a three-judge panel, reversed the 2015 decision of the U.S. Tax Court.

The increase in revenues is mainly attributable to an increase of $64.2 million in revenues from our vessels operating in the spot market due to the significant increase in LNG shipping spot rates during the year.

These deliveries resulted in an increase in operating days.

{"text": "Liability for Warranty Our products generally include warranties of 90 days to five years for product defects. We accrue for warranty returns at the time revenue is recognized based on our historical return rate and estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products. We engage in extensive product quality programs and processes, including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers. The increasing complexity of our products will cause warranty incidences, when they arise, to be more costly. Our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates, material usage and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure. In addition, from time to time, specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise. Should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates, we will be required to record additional warranty expense. Alternatively, if we provide for more reserves than we require, we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods. The liability for warranty obligations totaled $8.4 million and $8.6 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

{"text": "Purchased intangible assets include core and developed technology, in-process research and development, customer-related intangibles, acquisition-date backlog and other intangible assets. The estimated fair values of the core and developed technology and in-process research and development were determined based on the present value of the expected cash flows to be generated by the respective existing technology or future technology. The core and developed technology intangible assets are being amortized in a manner based on the expected cash flows used in the initial determination of fair value. In-process research and development is capitalized until such time as the related projects are completed or abandoned at which time the capitalized amounts will begin to be amortized or written off. Customer-related intangible assets consist of Atmel's contractual relationships and customer loyalty related to its distributor and end-customer relationships, and the fair values of the customerrelated intangibles were determined based on Atmel's projected revenues. An analysis of expected attrition and revenue growth for existing customers was prepared from Atmel's historical customer information. Customer relationships are being amortized in a manner based on the estimated cash flows associated with the existing customers and anticipated retention rates. Backlog relates to the value of orders not yet shipped by Atmel at the acquisition date, and the fair values were based on the estimated profit associated with those orders. Backlog related assets had a one year useful life and were being amortized on a straight line basis over that period. The total weighted average amortization period of intangible assets acquired as a result of the Atmel transaction is 9 years. Amortization expense associated with acquired intangible assets is not deductible for tax purposes. Thus, approximately $178.1 million was established as a net deferred tax liability for the future amortization of the intangible assets.", "doc_id": "46afe3a8850842baa72a18f41b495356", "source_type": "train"}

The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2020, subject to regulatory approval and other closing conditions. In addition, the Company, through a subsidiary of ATC Europe, entered into an agreement with its local partners in France to form Eure-et-Loir Réseaux Mobiles SAS (“Eure-et-Loir”), a telecommunications infrastructure company that owns and operates wireless communications towers in France. The Company’s controlling interest in Eure-et-Loir is 51% with local partners holding a 49% noncontrolling interest. The agreement provides the local partners with put options, which allow them to sell outstanding shares of Eure-et-Loir to the Company, and the Company with call options, which allow it to buy the noncontrolling shares of Eure-et-Loir. The put options, which are not under the Company’s control, cannot be separated from the noncontrolling interests.

The fair value exceeded the carrying value by 2.4%. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate goodwill for impairment.

These valuation approaches are dependent upon a number of factors, including estimates of future growth rates, our cost of capital, capital expenditures, income tax rates, and other variables. Assumptions used in our valuations were consistent with our internal projections and operating plans. Our discounted cash flows forecast could be negatively impacted by a change in the competitive landscape, any internal decisions to pursue new or different strategies, a loss of a significant customer, or a significant change in the market place including changes in the prices paid for our products or changes in the size of the market for our products. Additionally, under the market approach analysis, we used significant other observable inputs including various guideline company comparisons. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable, but which are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Changes in these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and the conclusions of the quantitative goodwill test for our one reporting unit.", "doc_id": "4ae3796a13184f8b9c16ce502638f466", "source_type": "train"}

{"text": "The foreign tax rate differential benefit primarily relates to the Company's operations in Thailand, Malta and Ireland. The Company's Thailand manufacturing operations are currently subject to numerous tax holidays granted to the Company based on its investment in property, plant and equipment in Thailand. The Company's tax holiday periods in Thailand expire between fiscal 2022 and 2026, however, the Company actively seeks to obtain new tax holidays. The Company does not expect the future expiration of any of its tax holiday periods in Thailand to have a material impact on its effective tax rate. The Company’s Microsemi operations in Malaysia are subject to a tax holiday that effectively reduces the income tax rate in that jurisdiction. Microsemi’s tax holiday in Malaysia was granted in 2009 and is effective through December 2019, subject to continued compliance with the tax holiday’s requirements. The aggregate dollar expense derived from these tax holidays approximated $0.1 million in fiscal 2019. The aggregate dollar benefit derived from these tax holidays approximated $6.2 million and $13.2 million in fiscal 2018 and 2017, respectively.

{"text": "Management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures may be useful to investors in certain instances to provide additional meaningful comparisons between current\n\nresults and results in prior operating periods. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation (“Adjusted EBITDA”) is a\n\nmetric used by management and frequently used by the financial community. Adjusted EBITDA from operations provides insight into an organization’s operating trends and\n\nfacilitates comparisons between peer companies, since interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and stock-based compensation can differ greatly between organizations as a\n\nresult of differing capital structures and tax strategies. Adjusted EBITDA from operations is one of the measures used for determining our debt covenant compliance.

Market-based PRSUs generally vest three years from the grant date if certain performance criteria are achieved and require continued employment. Based upon the terms of such awards, the number of shares that can be earned over the performance periods is based on the Company’s Common Stock price performance compared to the market price performance of the Philadelphia Semiconductor Sector Index (“SOX”), ranging from 0% to 150% of target. The stock price performance or market price performance is measured using the closing price for the 50-trading days prior to the dates the performance period begins and ends. The target number of shares represented by the market-based PRSUs is increased by 2% of target for each 1% that Common Stock price performance exceeds the market price performance of the SOX index. The result of the vesting formula is rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2019 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to earnings in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation, the Foreign Derived Intangible Income deduction, the tax effect of GILTI, and a reduction to our transition tax recorded consistent with the provision of SAB 118. Our provision for income taxes for fiscal 2018 varied from the 21% U.S. statutory rate imposed by the Tax Act primarily due to the impacts of the Tax Act upon adoption, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax credit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction. Prior to the January 1, 2018 effective date of the Tax Act, our provision for income taxes historically differed from the tax computed at the previous U.S. federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to certain earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations, state taxes, the U.S. research and development tax cr edit, settlements with tax authorities, the tax effects of stock-based compensation and the U.S. domestic production activity deduction.", "doc_id": "f14cde5d862c4f8bb0316678d463ea54", "source_type": "train"}

The Company writes off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $55,039 and $65,542 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Management identifies a delinquent customer based upon the delinquent payment status of an outstanding invoice, generally greater than 30 days past due date. The delinquent account designation does not trigger an accounting transaction until such time the account is deemed uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by examining the reserve history and any outstanding invoices that are over 30 days past due as of the end of the reporting period. Accounts are deemed uncollectible on a case-by-case basis, at management’s discretion based upon an examination of the communication with the delinquent customer and payment history.

{"text": "Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2018, we began monitoring a new operating metric, total annual recurring revenue (“Total ARR”), which is defined as the annualized value of all recurring revenue contracts active at the end of a reporting period. Total ARR includes the annualized value of subscriptions (“Subscription ARR”) and the annualized value of software support contracts related to perpetual licenses (“Perpetual license support ARR”) active at the end of a reporting period and does not include revenue reported as perpetual license or professional services in our consolidated statement of operations. We are monitoring these metrics because they align with how our customers are increasingly purchasing our solutions and how we are managing our business. These ARR measures should be viewed independently of revenue, unearned revenue, and customer arrangements with termination rights as ARR is an operating metric and is not intended to be combined with or replace those items. ARR is not an indicator of future revenue and can be impacted by contract start and end dates and renewal rates.", "doc_id": "4b913c2df90b48e2ba224c849aa018d9", "source_type": "train"}

{"text": "Operating Income: CGD had operating income of $16.6 million in 2018 compared to $28.1 million in 2017. The decrease in operating income was primarily caused by the gain of $8.0 million recognized in fiscal 2017 due to the approval of a contract adjustment with the U.S. Navy described above. In fiscal 2018 an arbitrator awarded $1.7 million to a former reseller of our air combat training systems in the Far East, which was recorded as SG&A expense by CGD in 2018. In addition, CGD’s R&D expenditures increased approximately $1.8 million year-over-year. The increase in R&D expenditures is indicative of the acceleration of our development of next generation live, virtual, constructive, and game-based training systems. These decreases in operating income in fiscal 2018 were partially offset by increased operating income from ground combat training systems, which was higher primarily due to improvements in expected total costs for the development of two ground combat training system contracts in the Far East. The average exchange rates between the prevailing currency in our foreign operations and the U.S. dollar had no significant impact on CGD operating income between 2017 and 2018.", "doc_id": "0597295d31094de1bef0dd864f28bf56", "source_type": "train"}

For 2018, operating income was higher from increased volumes of system development work and services, including work on new projects and change orders, primarily in North America and the U.K. Operating income was also higher due to operational efficiencies and reductions in R&D spending. R&D expenses for CTS in 2017 included $6.4 million of system development expenses related to our anticipated contract with the New York Metropolitan Transit Authority that was awarded in early fiscal 2018; such expenses incurred in 2018 on this contract are classified as cost of sales. During the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 CTS implemented our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, and as a result began depreciating the cost of certain capitalized software into its operating results. This resulted in a decrease in operating income of $4.2 million between fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2018.

{"text": "Deferred tax assets reflect the tax effects of net operating losses (“NOLs”), tax credit carryovers, and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. The most significant item of our deferred tax assets is derived from our Federal NOLs. We have approximately $167.8 million gross Federal NOLs at December 31, 2019 (of which approximately $160.2 million was generated prior to January 1, 2018). Because we believe the ability for us to use these NOLs generated prior to January 1, 2018 to offset any future taxable income is severely limited as prescribed under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 382, we had estimated and recorded an amount for the likely limitation to our deferred tax asset in the fourth quarter of 2017, thereby reducing the aggregate estimated benefit of the Federal NOLs available to us of approximately $1.0 million at December 31, 2017. We believe the gross Federal NOL benefit we generated prior to January 1, 2018 to offset taxable income is less than $150 thousand annually. As prescribed under Internal Revenue Code, any unused Federal NOL benefit from the annual limitation can be accumulated and carried forward to the subsequent year and will expire if not used in accordance with the NOL carried forward term of 20 years or 2037, if generated before 2018 and Federal NOLs generated after 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely. Future common stock transactions, such as the exercise of common stock purchase warrants or the conversion of debt into common stock, may cause another qualifying event under IRC 382 which may further limit our utilization of our NOLs.", "doc_id": "13c4e1741e994012b368453c8afa0eee", "source_type": "train"}

Also, in fiscal 2019 our CTS and CGD segments incurred restructuring charges, consisting primarily of employee severance costs related to headcount reductions initiated to optimize our cost positions. The total costs of each of these restructuring plans initiated thus far are not expected to be significantly greater than the charges incurred to date.", "doc_id": "86894d7395ab48dba0ea1612691420c1", "source_type": "train"}

Through the restructuring, Autodesk seeks to reduce its investments in areas not aligned with its strategic priorities, including in areas related to research and development and go-to-market activities.

By re-balancing resources to better align with the Company’s strategic priorities, Autodesk is positioning itself to meet its long-term goals.

{"text": "The shell egg industry has historically been subject to periods of high profitability followed by periods of significant\nloss. The periods of high profitability have often reflected increased consumer demand relative to supply while the\nperiods of significant loss have often reflected excess supply for the then prevailing consumer demand. Historically,\ndemand for shell eggs increases in line with overall population growth. As reflected above, our operating results\nfluctuate with changes in the spot egg market quote and feed costs. The net average shell egg selling price is the\nblended price for all sizes and grades of shell eggs, including non-graded shell egg sales, breaking stock and undergrades. In fiscal 2017, our net average selling price and dozens sold decreased over the previous fiscal year\nprimarily due to the oversupply of eggs resulting from the repopulation of the national flock of laying hens to levels\nexceeding the flock size prior to the avian influenza outbreak in 2015, along with a reduced demand for egg products. In\nfiscal 2018, strong demand resulted in an increase in our average selling price and dozens sold, and feed costs decreased\nover prior years. Fiscal 2019 saw an increasing U.S. flock size result in oversupply of eggs, particularly in the last half\nof the fiscal year.

{"text": "Use of the cost-to-cost or other similar methods of revenue recognition requires us to make reasonably dependable estimates regarding the revenue and cost associated with the design, manufacture and delivery of our products and services. Revisions or adjustments to estimates of the transaction price, estimated costs at completion and estimated profit or loss of a performance obligation are often required as work progresses under a contract, as experience is gained, as facts and circumstances change and as new information is obtained, even though the scope of work required under the contract may not change. In determining the estimated costs at completion, we have to make assumptions regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of the work to be performed, the availability of materials, estimated increases in wages and prices for materials, performance by our subcontractors, and the availability and timing of funding from our customer, among other variables. Revisions or adjustments to our estimated transaction price and estimated costs at completion may also be required if contract modifications occur. The revisions in contract estimates, if significant, can materially affect our results of operations and cash flows, and in some cases result in liabilities to complete contracts in a loss position. Based upon our history, we believe we have the ability to make reasonable estimates for these items. We have accounting policies and controls in place to address these, as well as other contractual and business arrangements to properly account for long-term contracts, and we continue to monitor and improve such policies, controls, and arrangements. For other information on such policies, controls and arrangements, see our discussion in Item 9A of this Form 10-K.", "doc_id": "300fc58f65244086862f52ce186b2d74", "source_type": "train"}
{"text": "Products and services provided under long-term, fixed-price contracts represented approximately 97% of our sales for 2019. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if our underlying circumstances were to change. For example, if underlying assumptions were to change such that our estimated profit rate at completion for all fixed-price contracts accounted for under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method was higher or lower by one percentage point, our 2019 operating income would have increased or decreased by approximately $6.5 million. When adjustments in estimated contract revenues or estimated costs at completion are required, any changes from prior estimates are recognized by recording adjustments in the current period for the inception-to-date effect of the changes on current and prior periods using the cumulative catch-up method of accounting. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined.", "doc_id": "73eb7ac6f31744beb9d70b19b511e807", "source_type": "train"}

The amount of the impairment allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. Cash flows relating to shortterm receivables are not discounted if the effect of discounting is immaterial.", "doc_id": "a21eff7e5fa921fa46d05758b32dc185", "source_type": "train"}

The constant currency decreases in our hardware revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 were due to a reduction in our hardware products revenues and hardware support revenues primarily due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our cloud-based infrastructure technologies, which resulted in reduced sales volumes of certain of our hardware product lines and also impacted the volume of customers that purchased hardware support contracts. The constant currency decrease in our services revenues during fiscal 2019 relative to fiscal 2018 was attributable to declines in our consulting and education services revenues. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 40%, 33% and 27%, respectively, to the growth in our fiscal 2019 total revenues.", "doc_id": "5299885fa06377fec67d5e7149460d90", "source_type": "train"}
