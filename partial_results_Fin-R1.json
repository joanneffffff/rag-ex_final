To find the cost of internally-developed software in 2019, we need to consider the difference between these two amounts. \n\nFirst, calculate the decrease in capitalized costs from 2018 to 2019:\n$7.7 million (2018) - $6.5 million (2019) = $1.2 million decrease.\n\nSince the R&D expense increased by $8.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018, but part of this increase ($1.2 million) is attributed to changes in capitalized software costs, the actual cost of internally-developed software would be the difference between the two years' capitalized amounts. However, the question asks for the \"cost\" of internally-developed software in 2019. Typically, capitalized software costs represent the asset on the balance sheet, not the expense recognized in the income statement. But according to the text, the increase in R&D expense included an increase due to capitalized software costs. \n\nWait, the text says: \"...resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.\" So the $8.7 million increase in R&D expense had a component of $1.2 million due to capitalized software costs. Therefore, the 2019 capitalized amount ($6.5M) represents the portion of software costs capitalized as assets, not expensed. However, the question is about the \"cost\" of internally-developed software in 2019. If they're asking for the expense recognized (not capitalized), then perhaps the answer is the difference between the two years' capitalized amounts plus other components. Wait, but the text mentions that the increase in expense was partly due to capitalized software costs. Let me parse this again.\n\nThe text says: \"In addition, a total of $6.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2019 and $7.7 million of internally-developed software costs during 2018 were capitalized, resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.\"\n\nSo, the capitalized amounts are $6.5M (2019) vs. $7.7",

The original salary before the promotion was $390,000, and after the promotion, it increased to $440,000. \n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage increase is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Salary} - \\text{Original Salary}}{\\text{Original Salary}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{440,000 - 390,000}{390,000} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the difference between the new and original salaries:\n\n\\[\n440,000 - 390,000 = 50,000\n\\]\n\nNext, divide this difference by the original salary:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50,000}{390,000} \\approx 0.1282\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.1282 \\times 100 \\approx 12.82\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage increase in Mr. Kapuria's salary from his promotion is approximately **12.82%**. This calculation confirms that the salary rise represents a significant step-up relative to his previous compensation, reflecting the executive role he assumed during FY19.\n</answer>",

        "raw_generated_text": "<answer>\nTo determine the total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results related to hedging transactions and hedging relationships, we need to carefully analyze the provided table context and text context. The question specifically asks for the total comprehensive income from these two categories. \n\nFirst, let's look at the table context. The paragraph states: \"The total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships totalled â‚¬17 million (2017/18: â‚¬âˆ’14 million).\" This directly provides the figure for the current period as â‚¬17 million. However, it also includes a comparison to the previous period (2017/18), which shows a negative value of âˆ’â‚¬14 million. But since the question is about the total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships, the key number here is â‚¬17 million.\n\nNext, the text context repeats the same information: \"The total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships totalled â‚¬17 million (2017/18: â‚¬âˆ’14 million).\" This confirms that the current period's amount is â‚¬17 million. Additionally, the text mentions \"other financial result reflects â‚¬âˆ’5 million (2017/18: â‚¬4 million)\" in currency effects from translating foreign subsidiaries' financial statements when they are deconsolidated or businesses are discontinued. It also notes impairment losses of â‚¬2 million. However, the question specifically asks for the total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships, not including other components like the translation effects or impairment losses. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be based solely on the first part of the sentence in both contexts, which explicitly states the total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships as â‚¬17 million. The other figures mentioned (âˆ’â‚¬5 million and â‚¬2 million) are separate items and do not contribute to this specific line item. \n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{17} million euros.\n</answer>",

The formula for percentage difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left| \\frac{\\text{Basic EPS} - \\text{Diluted EPS}}{\\text{Basic EPS}} \\right| \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFrom the table context, there are two years mentioned: 2018 and 2019. However, the table headers indicate that the data corresponds to \"December 31,\" but the values under \"Value\" for each metric are labeled as either 2019 or 329013 (which might represent the actual EPS values). Let's parse the relevant data points:\n\n- For 2018:\n  - Basic net earnings per share (from operations): 3.0\n  - Diluted net earnings per share: 2.96\n\n- For 2019:\n  - Basic net earnings per share (from operations): 6.66\n  - Diluted net earnings per share: 6.58\n\nNow, applying the formula to each year:\n\n### 2018 Calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Difference}_{2018} = \\left| \\frac{3.0 - 2.96}{3.0} \\right| \\times 100 = \\left| \\frac{0.04}{3.0} \\right| \\times 100 \\approx 1.33\\%\n\\]\n\n### 2019 Calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Difference}_{2019} = \\left| \\frac{6.66 - 6.58}{6.66} \\right| \\times 100 = \\left| \\frac{0.08}{6.66} \\right| \\times 100 \\approx 1.20\\%\n\\]\n\nComparing the two results, the percentage difference is lower in 2019 (approximately 1.20%) compared to 2018 (approximately 1.33%).

The user is asking for the value of the company's 2023-2024 purchase obligations as a percentage of its total payment due in that same period. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table. Let me look through the table context again. The table has several rows, each corresponding to different categories like operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, liability for uncertain tax positions, investment commitments, and a total row.\n\nThe key here is to find the \"Purchase obligations (2)\" row because the question specifically mentions purchase obligations. Looking at the table, under the \"Purchase obligations (2)\" section, the payments due by period for 2023-2024 are listed as 438 (in thousands). Then, the total for purchase obligations is 33,367 (also in thousands).\n\nWait, but the question is about the percentage of the 2023-2024 purchase obligations relative to the total payments due in that period. So, we need two numbers: the amount for 2023-2024 and the total for that period. However, looking at the table, the \"Total\" column shows the sum across all categories. For example, the total for 2023-2024 is 20,121 (thousands), which includes all categories except maybe the \"Other\" category since it's separate. Wait, the table's \"Total\" row might be aggregating all the individual totals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the \"Total\" row, the 2023-2024 payments due by period is 20,121 (thousands). That must be the sum of all the individual categories' 2023-2024 payments. Let me verify:\n\nOperating lease obligations (1) for 2023-2024: 19,683\n\nPurchase obligations (2): 438\n\nLiability for uncertain tax positions (3): 0 (since it's \"-\")\n\nInvestment commitments (4): 0 (since it's \"-\")\n\nSo adding those up: 19,683 + 438 = 20,121.

The table includes various categories such as operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, liability for uncertain tax positions, investment commitments, and their totals across different periods.\n\nFirst, let's locate the row corresponding to \"Operating lease obligations (1)\" in the table. From the text context:\n\n- For Operating lease obligations (1):  \n  2020: 19,373  \n  2021 - 2022: 36,373  \n  2023 - 2024 (Payments due by period): 19,683  \n  2025 and thereafter: 1,666  \n  Other: -  \n  Total: 77,095  \n\nThe question asks for the total operating lease obligations between 2020 to 2022. This would cover the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. However, the table breaks down payments into specific periods:  \n- 2020: 19,373  \n- 2021 - 2022: 36,373 (which spans two years but is aggregated here)  \n- 2023 - 2024: 19,683 (not relevant for 2020-2022)  \n- 2025 and thereafter: 1,666 (also not relevant)  \n\nWait, there might be confusion here. The \"2021 - 2022\" column represents the sum of payments for those two years combined. So if we want the total for 2020 alone, it's 19,373. For 2021 and 2022 together, it's 36,373. But the question is about the total between 2020 to 2022, which could be interpreted as the sum of all three years. However, looking at the table structure, each column after 2020 aggregates multiple years. Specifically, \"2021 - 2022\" is a range covering two years. Therefore, the values",

Let me start by looking at the table entries related to \"Americas\" and \"GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit.\"\n\nFrom the table, under the category \"% Customer Support Revenues by Geography,\" the Americas row shows that in 2019, the revenue was 57.6%. That seems straightforward. But wait, the question is about revenues as a percentage of gross profit, not just revenues themselves. So I need to find both the Americas' revenue and the total GAAP-based gross profit for 2019.\n\nLooking further into the table, there's a line item called \"Total Customer Support Revenues\" which is 1,247,915 (in thousands) for 2019. Then, the \"GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit\" is listed as 1,123,572 (also in thousands) for 2019. \n\nWait a second, but the question is phrased as \"Customer Support Revenues of Americas expressed as a percentage of GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit.\" That means we need to take the Americas' revenue (which is given as 57.6%) and express it relative to the total GAAP-based gross profit. However, the table might have these numbers already calculated. Let me check again.\n\nThe table has a column labeled \"GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit\" with values for each year. For 2019, it's 1,123,572 (thousands). The Americas' revenue as a percentage of this gross profit would be (Americas Revenue / GAAP Gross Profit) * 100. But wait, the Americas' revenue is already presented as a percentage of total revenues (57.6%), not directly as a dollar amount. Hmm, this could be confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is structured such that the percentages under \"% Customer Support Revenues by Geography\" represent the proportion of total customer support revenues. So, Americas contributed 57.6% of the total customer support revenues in 2019. Then, the total customer support revenues are $1,247,",

The table includes four categories of expenses: Finance costs, Data center rent paid to APDC (included in Data center facility costs), APDC transaction costs (included in Professional fees), and Landholder duty on acquisition of APDC properties (included in Office and administrative expenses). \n\nFirst, let's extract the relevant figures for each category under the column labeled \"$'000 (30 June 2018)\" since that corresponds to FY18. Here are the values:\n\n1. **Finance costs**: The note indicates that the value for 30 June 2018 is a negative 54,897 ($'000). This suggests a significant outflow related to finance costs, which could include interest expenses, loan repayments, or other financial obligations.\n\n2. **Data center rent paid to APDC**: For this item, the 30 June 2018 column shows a dash (\"-\"), indicating no reported expense or possibly zero expenditure for that period. However, the \"Column 4\" lists a negative 13,785 ($'000), but itâ€™s unclear what this represents without additional context. Since the question focuses on FY18 expenses, and the main column for 2018 doesn't show a value here, this might not contribute significantly to the total expenses for FY18.\n\n3. **APDC transaction costs**: The note states that the 30 June 2018 value is a negative 5,459 ($'000). Again, this would represent an expense, likely legal or advisory fees associated with transactions involving APDC.\n\n4. **Landholder duty on acquisition of APDC properties**: The 30 June 2018 value is a negative 3,498 ($'000), which would relate to taxes or duties incurred during property acquisitions linked to APDC.\n\nComparing these values, the largest absolute figure for FY18 is the Finance costs at -54,897 ($'000). While other items like APDC transaction costs and landholder duties also have negative values, they are substantially smaller than the finance costs. Additionally, the absence of a value for Data center rent in the 30 June 2018 column implies either no expense",

Since both 2019 and 2018 have entries of 2014, which seems inconsistent (likely a typo since 2014 is repeated instead of actual figures), but the key point is that these two years have non-zero entries compared to 2017's 2.4. However, the question specifically mentions \"Charges included in discontinued operations,\" and the table shows that for 2019 and 2018, the value is 2014, while 2017 is 2.4. Given that the question is asking for the year with such charges, both 2019 and 2018 would technically have charges if ignoring the possible data entry error. But since the user might be referring to the presence of non-zero charges, all three years except 2017 have entries. However, the answer likely expects the year where the charge was included, which is every year except 2017. But given the way the question is phrased, perhaps they want the earliest year with charges, which would be 2017. Wait, noâ€”the table shows 2017 as 2.4, which is non-zero. So all three years have charges, but the question might be trickier. Wait, looking back: The table lists \"Charges included in discontinued operations\" as 2019: 2014, 2018: 2014, 2017: 2.4. So 2019, 2018, and 2017 all have charges, but 2019 and 2018 have 2014, which is probably a mistake (maybe it should be another number like 14.3?), but according to the table, those are the values. Therefore, the answer would be that charges were included in discontinued operations for all three years listed, but the question might be seeking the year where the",

To determine this, we need to compare the \"Group share of associates' pre-tax profits\" with the \"Group share of associates' post-tax profits\" for 2018. \n\nFrom the table context:\n- The \"Group share of associates' pre-tax profits (3)\" for 2018 is listed as 1536 (though the exact value might be misaligned due to formatting). However, looking at the text context, under the category \"Group share of associates' post-tax profits (3)\", the 2018 value is explicitly stated as 1383. This suggests that the post-tax profit is lower than the pre-tax profit by some amount attributable to taxes. \n\nThe difference between pre-tax and post-tax profits would represent the tax impact. For 2018, the pre-tax profit is 1536, and the post-tax profit is 1383. The tax impact can be calculated as the reduction from pre-tax to post-tax, which is 1536 - 1383 = 153. To find the percentage change (i.e., the tax rate), divide the tax impact by the pre-tax profit: (153 / 1536) * 100 â‰ˆ 9.96%. However, since the question asks for the impact in terms of % change, it's possible they want the absolute change in post-tax compared to pre-tax, but more likely the tax rate itself.

The user is asking for the value of the 2017 restructuring charges as a percentage of the 2017 total goodwill impairment and restructuring charges. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data from the provided table and text context. Let me look through the information given. The table has several rows, but the key ones here are under the \"Goodwill impairment and restructuring charges\" category.

First, I need to understand what \"non-returning directors\" means. From the table context provided, there's a category labeled \"Non-Returning Directors:(4)\" which probably refers to directors who have left the board but still receive some form of compensation. However, looking at the data given, all the directors listed under \"Continuing Directors\" also have entries, but the text mentions \"Non-Returning Directors:(4)\" as a separate category.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking how many years the shares issued under the ESPP exceeded $2 million. From the provided data, we need to look at the table that shows the shares issued under the ESPP over three fiscal years: April 26, 2019; April 27, 2018 (year ended); and April 28, 2017. \n\nFirst, I'll locate the relevant column in the table. The table has two main rows: \"Shares issued under the ESPP\" and \"Proceeds from issuance of shares.\" The question is about shares issued, not proceeds, so we focus on the first row. \n\nLooking at the values:\n- For April 26, 2019: 3 million shares\n- For April 27, 2018 (year ended): 3 million shares\n- For April 28, 2017: 4 million shares\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of years when these shares exceeded $2 million. Each of these entries represents a fiscal year. So, each column corresponds to a different fiscal year. Let me confirm:\n\nThe table headers are:\n- April 26, 2019\n- April 27, 2018 (Year Ended)\n- April 28, 2017\n\nThese are likely the fiscal years ending in those dates. So, each column represents one fiscal year. Now, checking the shares issued under the ESPP for each year:\n\n- 2019: 3 million (exceeds $2M)\n- 2018: 3 million (exceeds $2M)\n- 2017: 4 million (exceeds $2M)\n\nSo all three years have shares exceeding $2 million. Therefore, the answer should be 3 years. But wait, the question says \"how many years,\" so it's just counting the number of years where the condition holds. Since all three years have more than $2 million, the answer would be 3 years. However, I need to make sure there isn't a misunderstanding here.

The user is asking for the difference in the gross carrying value between Trade Names and Non-Compete Agreements. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table. Let me look through the table context again. The table has entries for different categories under \"Other intangible assets\". Specifically, there's a row for \"Trade names\" with a gross carrying value of 1.4 million USD, and another row for \"Non-compete agreements\" with a gross carrying value of 0.9 million USD. \n\nWait, the question is about the difference between these two values. So, I just subtract the smaller number from the larger one. That would be 1.4 minus 0.9, which equals 0.5 million USD. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. \n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Trade names: Gross carrying value is 1.4\n- Non-compete agreements: Gross carrying value is 0.9\n\nYes, so 1.4 minus 0.9 is indeed 0.5. Therefore, the difference should be $0.5 million. \n\nI should also confirm that these are the correct categories. The text mentions \"Trade names\" and \"Non-compete agreements\" as separate line items, so no confusion there. There's no mention of other categories affecting these specific values. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems straightforward.

The first row indicates that the fiscal year-end is 2019, but the value listed is 2018. This suggests that the fiscal year ended in 2019 corresponds to the value of 2018. For each inventory category (Purchased parts and assemblies, Work-in-process, Finished goods), the fiscal year-end values are given as specific numbers (e.g., 134,298 for Purchased parts and assemblies). However, the question asks for the years in which Inventories were calculated. Since the table's fiscal year-end column lists 2019, but the value refers to 2018, it implies that the calculation for inventories occurred during the fiscal year ending in 2019, resulting in a value reflecting up to 2018. Therefore, the inventories were calculated for the fiscal year ending in 2019, but the data used might span up to the prior year (2018). However, the exact years when the calculations were performed aren't directly stated; the table only provides the fiscal year-end dates and corresponding values. Given the structure, the fiscal year-end for all entries is 2019, so the inventories were calculated as of that date. But since the value under \"Value\" for total inventories is 486,741, which could correspond to the fiscal year 2018, there might be a discrepancy between the fiscal year end-date and the actual period covered by the inventory valuation. However, based strictly on the table, the fiscal year-end is 2019, so the inventories would be calculated for that fiscal year. But the value reflects the cumulative up to 2018. The question is asking for the years in which inventories were calculated. If the fiscal year-end is 2019, then the calculation would have been done during that fiscal year, likely around the end of 2019. However, the value being labeled as 2018 suggests that the data includes up to the previous year. But without explicit dates in the text, we can only infer from the table. The answer should reflect the fiscal year-end mentioned, which is 2019, even though the value is for 2018. So the inventories were calculated for the fiscal year ending",

These figures represent reductions in the carrying value due to estimated recoverable amounts falling below their book value.\n  \n- For **Operating lease right-of-use assets**, the impairment loss for 2019 is listed as $(1,711). However, there are no entries provided for 2018 and 2017, indicated by \"â€”\" in the table. This suggests that operating lease right-of-use assets did not experience impairment losses during those years.\n\nThus, the types of impairment losses under Americas are explicitly tied to these two asset categories, with specific numerical values tied to each year.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the average deferral of revenues from 2017 to 2019. First, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table and text context.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row labeled \"Deferral of revenue\" with values for each year. Let me check the rows again. The table has several entries under different categories like beginning balances, deferrals, recognition, and ending balances. Specifically, the \"Deferral of revenue\" row shows the following values:\n\n- For 2019: 45,040 (thousands)\n- For 2018: 40,003 (thousands)\n- For 2017: 46,193 (thousands)\n\nWait, but wait a second. The table headers mention \"December 31,\" which might indicate that these numbers correspond to the end of each respective year. So, the 2019 value is as of December 31, 2019; 2018 is December 31, 2018; and 2017 is December 31, 2017. That makes sense because financial statements typically report year-end figures.\n\nThe question is about the average deferral over these three years. To find the average, I need to sum the deferral amounts for each year and then divide by three. Let me confirm the numbers again:\n\n- 2017: 46,193\n- 2018: 40,003\n- 2019: 45,040\n\nAdding them up: 46,193 + 40,003 + 45,040. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, add 46,193 and 40,003. That equals 86,196. Then add 45,040 to that sum. 86,196 + 45,040 = 131,236. Now, divide this total by 3 to get the average. \n\n131,236 Ã· 3 = 43,745.333... Since we're dealing",

From the provided table context, I need to locate the relevant figures for these two categories.\n\nFirst, looking at the table rows labeled \"Debt obligations(1)\" and \"Purchase obligations(3)\". For Debt obligations, the total is listed as 341,250 (in thousands of USD). For Purchase obligations, the total is 192,981 (also in thousands). \n\nTo find the difference, I subtract the purchase obligations from the debt obligations: 341,250 - 192,981.

So 149,250 - 981 = 148,269. Therefore, the difference should be $148,269 thousand USD. \n\nWait, but I should double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't transpose any digits. The debt total is definitely 341,250 and purchase is 192,981. Yes, subtracting those gives 148,269. That seems correct. No other categories seem involved here since the question specifically asks about debt and purchase obligations.
