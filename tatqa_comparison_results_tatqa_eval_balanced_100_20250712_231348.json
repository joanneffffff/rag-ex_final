To find the cost of internally-developed software in 2019, we need to consider the difference between these two amounts. \n\nFirst, calculate the decrease in capitalized costs from 2018 to 2019:\n$7.7 million (2018) - $6.5 million (2019) = $1.2 million decrease.\n\nSince the R&D expense increased by $8.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018, but part of this increase ($1.2 million) is attributed to changes in capitalized software costs, the actual cost of internally-developed software would be the difference between the two years' capitalized amounts. However, the question asks for the \"cost\" of internally-developed software in 2019. Typically, capitalized software costs represent the asset on the balance sheet, not the expense recognized in the income statement. But according to the text, the increase in R&D expense included an increase due to capitalized software costs. \n\nWait, the text says: \"...resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.\" So the $8.7 million increase in R&D expense had a component of $1.2 million due to capitalized software costs. Therefore, the 2019 capitalized amount ($6.5M) represents the portion of software costs capitalized as assets, not expensed. However, the question is about the \"cost\" of internally-developed software in 2019. If they're asking for the expense recognized (not capitalized), then perhaps the answer is the difference between the two years' capitalized amounts plus other components. Wait, but the text mentions that the increase in expense was partly due to capitalized software costs. Let me parse this again.\n\nThe text says: \"In addition, a total of $6.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2019 and $7.7 million of internally-developed software costs during 2018 were capitalized, resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.\"\n\nSo, the capitalized amounts are $6.5M (2019) vs. $7.7",

The original salary before the promotion was $390,000, and after the promotion, it increased to $440,000. \n\nThe formula for calculating the percentage increase is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{New Salary} - \\text{Original Salary}}{\\text{Original Salary}} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values into the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Increase} = \\left( \\frac{440,000 - 390,000}{390,000} \\right) \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFirst, calculate the difference between the new and original salaries:\n\n\\[\n440,000 - 390,000 = 50,000\n\\]\n\nNext, divide this difference by the original salary:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{50,000}{390,000} \\approx 0.1282\n\\]\n\nFinally, multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage:\n\n\\[\n0.1282 \\times 100 \\approx 12.82\\%\n\\]\n\nThus, the percentage increase in Mr. Kapuria's salary from his promotion is approximately **12.82%**. This calculation confirms that the salary rise represents a significant step-up relative to his previous compensation, reflecting the executive role he assumed during FY19.\n</answer>",

The question specifically asks for the total comprehensive income from these two categories. \n\nFirst, let's look at the table context. The paragraph states: \"The total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships totalled €17 million (2017/18: €−14 million).\" This directly provides the figure for the current period as €17 million. However, it also includes a comparison to the previous period (2017/18), which shows a negative value of −€14 million. But since the question is about the total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships, the key number here is €17 million.\n\nNext, the text context repeats the same information: \"The total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships totalled €17 million (2017/18: €−14 million).\" This confirms that the current period's amount is €17 million. Additionally, the text mentions \"other financial result reflects €−5 million (2017/18: €4 million)\" in currency effects from translating foreign subsidiaries' financial statements when they are deconsolidated or businesses are discontinued. It also notes impairment losses of €2 million. However, the question specifically asks for the total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships, not including other components like the translation effects or impairment losses. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be based solely on the first part of the sentence in both contexts, which explicitly states the total comprehensive income from currency effects and measurement results from hedging transactions and hedging relationships as €17 million. The other figures mentioned (−€5 million and €2 million) are separate items and do not contribute to this specific line item. \n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{17} million euros.\n</answer>",

The formula for percentage difference is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Difference} = \\left| \\frac{\\text{Basic EPS} - \\text{Diluted EPS}}{\\text{Basic EPS}} \\right| \\times 100\n\\]\n\nFrom the table context, there are two years mentioned: 2018 and 2019. However, the table headers indicate that the data corresponds to \"December 31,\" but the values under \"Value\" for each metric are labeled as either 2019 or 329013 (which might represent the actual EPS values). Let's parse the relevant data points:\n\n- For 2018:\n  - Basic net earnings per share (from operations): 3.0\n  - Diluted net earnings per share: 2.96\n\n- For 2019:\n  - Basic net earnings per share (from operations): 6.66\n  - Diluted net earnings per share: 6.58\n\nNow, applying the formula to each year:\n\n### 2018 Calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Difference}_{2018} = \\left| \\frac{3.0 - 2.96}{3.0} \\right| \\times 100 = \\left| \\frac{0.04}{3.0} \\right| \\times 100 \\approx 1.33\\%\n\\]\n\n### 2019 Calculation:\n\\[\n\\text{Percentage Difference}_{2019} = \\left| \\frac{6.66 - 6.58}{6.66} \\right| \\times 100 = \\left| \\frac{0.08}{6.66} \\right| \\times 100 \\approx 1.20\\%\n\\]\n\nComparing the two results, the percentage difference is lower in 2019 (approximately 1.20%) compared to 2018 (approximately 1.33%).

The user is asking for the value of the company's 2023-2024 purchase obligations as a percentage of its total payment due in that same period. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table. Let me look through the table context again. The table has several rows, each corresponding to different categories like operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, liability for uncertain tax positions, investment commitments, and a total row.\n\nThe key here is to find the \"Purchase obligations (2)\" row because the question specifically mentions purchase obligations. Looking at the table, under the \"Purchase obligations (2)\" section, the payments due by period for 2023-2024 are listed as 438 (in thousands). Then, the total for purchase obligations is 33,367 (also in thousands).\n\nWait, but the question is about the percentage of the 2023-2024 purchase obligations relative to the total payments due in that period. So, we need two numbers: the amount for 2023-2024 and the total for that period. However, looking at the table, the \"Total\" column shows the sum across all categories. For example, the total for 2023-2024 is 20,121 (thousands), which includes all categories except maybe the \"Other\" category since it's separate. Wait, the table's \"Total\" row might be aggregating all the individual totals. Let me check:\n\nLooking at the \"Total\" row, the 2023-2024 payments due by period is 20,121 (thousands). That must be the sum of all the individual categories' 2023-2024 payments. Let me verify:\n\nOperating lease obligations (1) for 2023-2024: 19,683\n\nPurchase obligations (2): 438\n\nLiability for uncertain tax positions (3): 0 (since it's \"-\")\n\nInvestment commitments (4): 0 (since it's \"-\")\n\nSo adding those up: 19,683 + 438 = 20,121. Yes, that matches the total given in the \"Total\" row for 2023-2",

The table includes various categories such as operating lease obligations, purchase obligations, liability for uncertain tax positions, investment commitments, and their totals across different periods.\n\nFirst, let's locate the row corresponding to \"Operating lease obligations (1)\" in the table. From the text context:\n\n- For Operating lease obligations (1):  \n  2020: 19,373  \n  2021 - 2022: 36,373  \n  2023 - 2024 (Payments due by period): 19,683  \n  2025 and thereafter: 1,666  \n  Other: -  \n  Total: 77,095  \n\nThe question asks for the total operating lease obligations between 2020 to 2022. This would cover the years 2020, 2021, and 2022. However, the table breaks down payments into specific periods:  \n- 2020: 19,373  \n- 2021 - 2022: 36,373 (which spans two years but is aggregated here)  \n- 2023 - 2024: 19,683 (not relevant for 2020-2022)  \n- 2025 and thereafter: 1,666 (also not relevant)  \n\nWait, there might be confusion here. The \"2021 - 2022\" column represents the sum of payments for those two years combined. So if we want the total for 2020 alone, it's 19,373. For 2021 and 2022 together, it's 36,373. But the question is about the total between 2020 to 2022, which could be interpreted as the sum of all three years.

Let me start by looking at the table entries related to \"Americas\" and \"GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit.\"\n\nFrom the table, under the category \"% Customer Support Revenues by Geography,\" the Americas row shows that in 2019, the revenue was 57.6%. That seems straightforward. But wait, the question is about revenues as a percentage of gross profit, not just revenues themselves. So I need to find both the Americas' revenue and the total GAAP-based gross profit for 2019.\n\nLooking further into the table, there's a line item called \"Total Customer Support Revenues\" which is 1,247,915 (in thousands) for 2019.

For 2019, it's 1,123,572 (thousands). The Americas' revenue as a percentage of this gross profit would be (Americas Revenue / GAAP Gross Profit) * 100. But wait, the Americas' revenue is already presented as a percentage of total revenues (57.6%), not directly as a dollar amount. Hmm, this could be confusing.\n\nWait, perhaps the table is structured such that the percentages under \"% Customer Support Revenues by Geography\" represent the proportion of total customer support revenues.

The table includes four categories of expenses: Finance costs, Data center rent paid to APDC (included in Data center facility costs), APDC transaction costs (included in Professional fees), and Landholder duty on acquisition of APDC properties (included in Office and administrative expenses). \n\nFirst, let's extract the relevant figures for each category under the column labeled \"$'000 (30 June 2018)\" since that corresponds to FY18. Here are the values:\n\n1. **Finance costs**: The note indicates that the value for 30 June 2018 is a negative 54,897 ($'000). This suggests a significant outflow related to finance costs, which could include interest expenses, loan repayments, or other financial obligations.\n\n2. **Data center rent paid to APDC**: For this item, the 30 June 2018 column shows a dash (\"-\"), indicating no reported expense or possibly zero expenditure for that period. However, the \"Column 4\" lists a negative 13,785 ($'000), but it’s unclear what this represents without additional context. Since the question focuses on FY18 expenses, and the main column for 2018 doesn't show a value here, this might not contribute significantly to the total expenses for FY18.\n\n3. **APDC transaction costs**: The note states that the 30 June 2018 value is a negative 5,459 ($'000). Again, this would represent an expense, likely legal or advisory fees associated with transactions involving APDC.\n\n4. **Landholder duty on acquisition of APDC properties**: The 30 June 2018 value is a negative 3,498 ($'000), which would relate to taxes or duties incurred during property acquisitions linked to APDC.\n\nComparing these values, the largest absolute figure for FY18 is the Finance costs at -54,897 ($'000). While other items like APDC transaction costs and landholder duties also have negative values, they are substantially smaller than the finance costs. Additionally, the absence of a value for Data center rent in the 30 June 2018 column implies either no expense",

Since both 2019 and 2018 have entries of 2014, which seems inconsistent (likely a typo since 2014 is repeated instead of actual figures), but the key point is that these two years have non-zero entries compared to 2017's 2.4. However, the question specifically mentions \"Charges included in discontinued operations,\" and the table shows that for 2019 and 2018, the value is 2014, while 2017 is 2.4. Given that the question is asking for the year with such charges, both 2019 and 2018 would technically have charges if ignoring the possible data entry error. But since the user might be referring to the presence of non-zero charges, all three years except 2017 have entries. However, the answer likely expects the year where the charge was included, which is every year except 2017.

So all three years have charges, but the question might be trickier. Wait, looking back: The table lists \"Charges included in discontinued operations\" as 2019: 2014, 2018: 2014, 2017: 2.4. So 2019, 2018, and 2017 all have charges, but 2019 and 2018 have 2014, which is probably a mistake (maybe it should be another number like 14.3?), but according to the table, those are the values. Therefore, the answer would be that charges were included in discontinued operations for all three years listed, but the question might be seeking the year where the",

        "raw_generated_text": "\\boxed{-24.1\\%}\nThe question asks for the impact of tax on the group share of associates' profits in 2018, expressed as a percentage change. To determine this, we need to compare the \"Group share of associates' pre-tax profits\" with the \"Group share of associates' post-tax profits\" for 2018. \n\nFrom the table context:\n- The \"Group share of associates' pre-tax profits (3)\" for 2018 is listed as 1536 (though the exact value might be misaligned due to formatting). However, looking at the text context, under the category \"Group share of associates' post-tax profits (3)\", the 2018 value is explicitly stated as 1383. This suggests that the post-tax profit is lower than the pre-tax profit by some amount attributable to taxes. \n\nThe difference between pre-tax and post-tax profits would represent the tax impact. For 2018, the pre-tax profit is 1536, and the post-tax profit is 1383. The tax impact can be calculated as the reduction from pre-tax to post-tax, which is 1536 - 1383 = 153. To find the percentage change (i.e., the tax rate), divide the tax impact by the pre-tax profit: (153 / 1536) * 100 ≈ 9.96%. However, since the question asks for the impact in terms of % change, it's possible they want the absolute change in post-tax compared to pre-tax, but more likely the tax rate itself. But wait, the table already provides the \"Change in constant currency\" for pre-tax and post-tax. Wait, no—the table shows \"Change\" and \"Change in constant currency\" for each line item. Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table rows:\n\nUnder \"Group share of associates' pre-tax profits (3)\", the 2018 value is 1536, and the \"Change\" column is 2461.

The user is asking for the value of the 2017 restructuring charges as a percentage of the 2017 total goodwill impairment and restructuring charges. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data from the provided table and text context. Let me look through the information given. The table has several rows, but the key ones here are under the \"Goodwill impairment and restructuring charges\" category. Specifically, there's a row for \"Restructuring charges\" and another for \"Goodwill impairment,\" along with their respective values for 2017 and 2018.\n\nLooking at the table, the first thing I notice is that the years mentioned are 2018 and 2017.

The table shows that for the year ended December 31, 2018, the restructuring charges are listed as $-, which might indicate no activity or perhaps a placeholder. However, the value column for restructuring charges under 2018 is 752, and the change amount is $(752). But wait, the question is about 2017, not 2018. Hmm, this could be confusing.

Alternatively, maybe the table is structured such that the columns represent different years, but the way it's presented here is unclear. Wait, the table columns are labeled as \"For the Year Ended December 31,\" followed by commas and then \"Change Amount.\" So each column represents a different year?

First, I need to understand what \"non-returning directors\" means. From the table context provided, there's a category labeled \"Non-Returning Directors:(4)\" which probably refers to directors who have left the board but still receive some form of compensation. However, looking at the data given, all the directors listed under \"Continuing Directors\" also have entries, but the text mentions \"Non-Returning Directors:(4)\" as a separate category. Wait, maybe the numbers here are all continuing directors? Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the table rows, each director is listed under \"Continuing Directors,\" and there's no explicit mention of non-returning directors in the table data provided. The last few entries might be part of that category, indicated by \"(4)\" next to \"Non-Returning Directors.\" For example, Mary L Landrieu, Harvey P Perry, and Glen F Post, III are listed after the continuing directors. So perhaps the first set are continuing directors, and the latter three are non-returning. But the way it's presented is a bit unclear.

That seems conflicting because the text says \"Non-Returning Directors:(4)\" as a separate category. Maybe there was a formatting error in the original document, and those three should be under the non-returning category. Alternatively, perhaps the numbering in the table is off. Let me look again.\n\nIn the table context, after listing all the continuing directors, there's a line that starts with \"Category: Non-Returning Directors:(4).\" Then follows entries like Mary L Landrieu, Harvey P Perry, etc. So likely, those three are the non-returning directors.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking how many years the shares issued under the ESPP exceeded $2 million. From the provided data, we need to look at the table that shows the shares issued under the ESPP over three fiscal years: April 26, 2019; April 27, 2018 (year ended); and April 28, 2017. \n\nFirst, I'll locate the relevant column in the table. The table has two main rows: \"Shares issued under the ESPP\" and \"Proceeds from issuance of shares.\" The question is about shares issued, not proceeds, so we focus on the first row. \n\nLooking at the values:\n- For April 26, 2019: 3 million shares\n- For April 27, 2018 (year ended): 3 million shares\n- For April 28, 2017: 4 million shares\n\nWait, but the question is about the number of years when these shares exceeded $2 million. Each of these entries represents a fiscal year. So, each column corresponds to a different fiscal year. Let me confirm:\n\nThe table headers are:\n- April 26, 2019\n- April 27, 2018 (Year Ended)\n- April 28, 2017\n\nThese are likely the fiscal years ending in those dates. So, each column represents one fiscal year. Now, checking the shares issued under the ESPP for each year:\n\n- 2019: 3 million (exceeds $2M)\n- 2018: 3 million (exceeds $2M)\n- 2017: 4 million (exceeds $2M)\n\nSo all three years have shares exceeding $2 million. Therefore, the answer should be 3 years. But wait, the question says \"how many years,\" so it's just counting the number of years where the condition holds. Since all three years have more than $2 million, the answer would be 3 years. However, I need to make sure there isn't a misunderstanding here. The table might be showing cumulative figures or something else? Wait, looking back at the text context, the paragraph mentions that as of April 26, 2019, 7 million shares were available for",

The user is asking for the difference in the gross carrying value between Trade Names and Non-Compete Agreements. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table. Let me look through the table context again. The table has entries for different categories under \"Other intangible assets\". Specifically, there's a row for \"Trade names\" with a gross carrying value of 1.4 million USD, and another row for \"Non-compete agreements\" with a gross carrying value of 0.9 million USD. \n\nWait, the question is about the difference between these two values. So, I just subtract the smaller number from the larger one. That would be 1.4 minus 0.9, which equals 0.5 million USD. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. \n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Trade names: Gross carrying value is 1.4\n- Non-compete agreements: Gross carrying value is 0.9\n\nYes, so 1.4 minus 0.9 is indeed 0.5. Therefore, the difference should be $0.5 million. \n\nI should also confirm that these are the correct categories. The text mentions \"Trade names\" and \"Non-compete agreements\" as separate line items, so no confusion there. There's no mention of other categories affecting these specific values. \n\nTherefore, the calculation seems straightforward. The difference is 0.5 million dollars.\n</think>\n<answer>\nThe difference in the gross carrying value between Trade Names and Non-Compete Agreements is calculated by subtracting the gross carrying value of Non-Compete Agreements from that of Trade Names. According to the table:\n\n- **Trade Names**: Gross carrying value = \\$1.4 million  \n- **Non-Compete Agreements**: Gross carrying value = \\$0.9 million  \n\n**Difference** = \\$1.4 million - \\$0.9 million = **\\$0.5 million**.\n\n\\boxed{0.5}\n</answer>",

The first row indicates that the fiscal year-end is 2019, but the value listed is 2018. This suggests that the fiscal year ended in 2019 corresponds to the value of 2018. For each inventory category (Purchased parts and assemblies, Work-in-process, Finished goods), the fiscal year-end values are given as specific numbers (e.g., 134,298 for Purchased parts and assemblies). However, the question asks for the years in which Inventories were calculated. Since the table's fiscal year-end column lists 2019, but the value refers to 2018, it implies that the calculation for inventories occurred during the fiscal year ending in 2019, resulting in a value reflecting up to 2018. Therefore, the inventories were calculated for the fiscal year ending in 2019, but the data used might span up to the prior year (2018). However, the exact years when the calculations were performed aren't directly stated; the table only provides the fiscal year-end dates and corresponding values. Given the structure, the fiscal year-end for all entries is 2019, so the inventories were calculated as of that date. But since the value under \"Value\" for total inventories is 486,741, which could correspond to the fiscal year 2018, there might be a discrepancy between the fiscal year end-date and the actual period covered by the inventory valuation. However, based strictly on the table, the fiscal year-end is 2019, so the inventories would be calculated for that fiscal year. But the value reflects the cumulative up to 2018. The question is asking for the years in which inventories were calculated. If the fiscal year-end is 2019, then the calculation would have been done during that fiscal year, likely around the end of 2019. However, the value being labeled as 2018 suggests that the data includes up to the previous year. But without explicit dates in the text, we can only infer from the table. The answer should reflect the fiscal year-end mentioned, which is 2019, even though the value is for 2018. So the inventories were calculated for the fiscal year ending",

This suggests that operating lease right-of-use assets did not experience impairment losses during those years.\n\nThus, the types of impairment losses under Americas are explicitly tied to these two asset categories, with specific numerical values tied to each year. The absence of entries for operating lease right-of-use assets in 2018 and 2017 implies no such impairments occurred during those periods. \n\n\\boxed{\\text{Property and equipment, net; Operating lease right-of-use assets}}\n</answer>",

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking for the average deferral of revenues from 2017 to 2019. First, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table and text context.\n\nLooking at the table, there's a row labeled \"Deferral of revenue\" with values for each year. Let me check the rows again. The table has several entries under different categories like beginning balances, deferrals, recognition, and ending balances. Specifically, the \"Deferral of revenue\" row shows the following values:\n\n- For 2019: 45,040 (thousands)\n- For 2018: 40,003 (thousands)\n- For 2017: 46,193 (thousands)\n\nWait, but wait a second. The table headers mention \"December 31,\" which might indicate that these numbers correspond to the end of each respective year. So, the 2019 value is as of December 31, 2019; 2018 is December 31, 2018; and 2017 is December 31, 2017. That makes sense because financial statements typically report year-end figures.\n\nThe question is about the average deferral over these three years. To find the average, I need to sum the deferral amounts for each year and then divide by three. Let me confirm the numbers again:\n\n- 2017: 46,193\n- 2018: 40,003\n- 2019: 45,040\n\nAdding them up: 46,193 + 40,003 + 45,040. Let me compute that step by step. \n\nFirst, add 46,193 and 40,003. That equals 86,196. Then add 45,040 to that sum. 86,196 + 45,040 = 131,236. Now, divide this total by 3 to get the average. \n\n131,236 ÷ 3 = 43,745.333... Since we're dealing",

So 149,250 - 981 = 148,269. Therefore, the difference should be $148,269 thousand USD. \n\nWait, but I should double-check the numbers to make sure I didn't transpose any digits. The debt total is definitely 341,250 and purchase is 192,981. Yes, subtracting those gives 148,269. That seems correct.

The text also mentions that the recoverable amount is determined using value-in-use calculations with cash flow projections from the latest three-year plan.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking what caused the increase in research and development (R&D) expenses. I need to look at both the table and text context provided.\n\nFirst, the key point is that R&D expenses increased by $19.1 million in 2018 compared to 2017. The main reason given in both contexts is the increase in employee-related costs. Specifically, there's a $18.1 million rise due to more employees—headcount went up from 159 to 229. That's a significant jump, so more staff likely means higher salaries and benefits, including stock-based compensation.\n\nThen there's the remaining increase. After accounting for the employee costs, the rest comes down to other factors. The text mentions a $2.9 million increase in hosting and software costs for R&D, plus a $0.3 million rise in software subscriptions. However, there's a $1.0 million decrease in office-related expenses, which partially offsets some of those increases. \n\nAdditionally, the text notes that $7.8 million and $6.3 million of internally developed software costs were capitalized in 2018 and 2017 respectively. This capitalization reduces the expense, leading to a $1.4 million decrease compared to 2017. Wait, but the overall increase is still $19.1 million. So even though part of the software costs were capitalized (thus reducing expenses), the main drivers are the employee costs, hosting/software, and subscriptions. \n\nPutting it all together, the primary cause is the increased headcount leading to higher employee-related costs, especially stock-based compensation. The other factors are secondary but contribute to the total increase. The answer should highlight the employee-related costs first, then the other components like hosting, software, and subscriptions, while noting the offsetting decrease in office expenses. Also, mention the impact of capitalizing internal software costs, which actually reduced the expense but didn't fully counteract the main increases.\n</think>\n\n<answer>The increase in research and development expense was primarily due to a $18.1 million rise in employee-related costs (including stock-based compensation) from expanded headcount (159 to 229 employees), supplemented by a $2.9 million increase in hosting/software costs and a $0.3 million rise in software subscriptions.

The rest of the information about the increase in R&D expenses is due to other factors like employee costs, hosting, and office expenses. The $1.2 million increase in expense is from the difference between the 2019 and 2018 capitalized amounts ($6.5M - $7.7M = -$1.2M, but since it's an increase in expense, maybe the accounting treatment capitalizes some and expenses the rest? Wait, but the wording says that the $6.5M and $7.7M were capitalized, leading to an increase in expense. Hmm, perhaps the amount capitalized affects the expense. If they capitalize more in 2019, then the expense would be less? Or maybe the non-capitalized portion is what's included in the expense. But the question is specifically about the cost of internally-developed software in 2019, which is stated as $6.5 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no confusion here. The text clearly states that during 2019, $6.5 million were capitalized. So the answer should be $6.5 million.

Then, 50,000 divided by 390,000 equals approximately 0.1282. Multiplying by 100 gives 12.82%. Let me confirm the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the values. Yes, original is 390k, new is 440k. The calculation seems right. So the percentage increase should be around 12.82%, which rounds to 12.8% or maybe 12.82% depending on required decimal places.

The user wants to know the reason for the change in other income from 2018 to 2019. \n\nFirst, I'll check the Table Context and Text Context provided. Both mention that other income increased by $119.4 million in 2019 compared to 2018. The main reasons given are a gain on an equity investment with readily determinable fair value. In 2019, there was a $158.3 million gain, whereas in 2018, there was a $6.4 million loss. So the difference here is $158.3 + $6.4 = $164.7 million, which contributes significantly to the increase.\n\nAdditionally, the text mentions gains on the sale of equity investments. In 2019, it was $17.7 million, while in 2018 it was $54.2 million. Wait, that seems like a decrease from 2018 to 2019. But the total other income still increased. So maybe the gain from the equity investment (the first part) is the primary factor. The gain on sale of equity investments in 2019 is lower than 2018, but the overall other income increased because the gain on the equity investment reversed the previous loss. \n\nSo putting it all together, the main reason is the $158.3 million gain in 2019 versus a $6.4 million loss in 2018. That's a positive impact of $158.3 + $6.4 = $164.7 million. Even though the gain on sale of equity investments decreased from $54.2M to $17.7M, the net effect is still an increase in other income due to the reversal of the loss and the gain from the equity investment. Therefore, the primary reason is the gain on the equity investment with readily determinable fair value.\n</think>\n\n<answer>The change in other income from 2018 to 2019 was primarily due to a $158.3 million gain on an equity investment with readily determinable fair value in 2019, compared to a $6.4 million loss in 2018, resulting in a $164.7 million positive adjustment.",

The user is asking for the amount of expenses for long-term remuneration components in FY2019. \n\nFirst, I need to check the Table Context and Text Context provided. Both seem to refer to the same paragraph. Let me read through them again.\n\nIn the Text Context, it says: \"Wages and salaries also include expenses for long-term remuneration components totalling €7 million (2017/18: €16 million).\" Wait, the years here are listed as 2017/18 and then the current period. But the question is about FY2019. However, the data given here only mentions 2017/18 and doesn't explicitly state the figure for 2018/19 or 2019. \n\nWait, but maybe there's more context. The variable remuneration went up from €52 million in 2017/18 to €81 million in 2018/19. But that's variable remuneration, not the long-term components. \n\nThe key part is the long-term remuneration expenses. The text says \"totalling €7 million (2017/18: €16 million)\". So the figure for the current period (which would be 2018/19) is €7 million? Or is the 2017/18 figure the previous one, and the current is missing?\n\nWait, the way it's written: \"expenses for long-term remuneration components totalling €7 million (2017/18: €16 million)\". This seems like a comparison. So in 2017/18, it was €16 million, and in the current period (which would be 2018/19), it's €7 million. But the user is asking for FY2019. However, the fiscal years might be structured differently. If the periods are 2017/18 (which is likely ending in 2018) and 2018/19 (ending in 2019), then the €7 million would correspond to 2018/19, which ends in 2019. Therefore, the answer should be €7 million.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking",

Both paragraphs mention that deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting versus income tax purposes. The table lists components of deferred tax assets and liabilities in thousands.\n\nSo, the key point here is temporary differences. These differences arise because certain items are accounted for differently under financial accounting standards (like GAAP) compared to tax regulations. For example, depreciation methods or revenue recognition might differ. When these differences reverse over time, they affect taxable income, leading to either tax assets (future tax savings) or liabilities (future tax payments). \n\nThe answer needs to capture that deferred income taxes reflect these temporary differences and their net effect. The user might be looking for a concise definition, possibly for a finance-related exam or report. They might also want to know the purpose of deferred taxes, which is to account for future tax consequences of current transactions. \n\nI should make sure not to include extra details beyond what's in the context.

The user is asking for the total number of exercisable shares excluded for 2019 and 2018 altogether.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the Table Context and Text Context provided. Both mention the same paragraphs. The key part is in Paragraph ID: 9e63690c65c29e4ced52df2d76739e68. It states that for 2019, the exercisable shares excluded are 1,216,000 and for 2018, it's 1,259,500. \n\nWait, the question is about the total of both years. So I just add those two numbers together. Let me check if there's any other info in the text context. The other paragraph talks about reconciliations but doesn't mention the numbers again. So the answer should be 1,216,000 + 1,259,500. Let me calculate that. \n\nAdding them: 1,216,000 plus 1,259,500 equals 2,475,500. But wait, the units here—are these numbers in thousands? The note says \"in thousands\" in the second paragraph, but the first paragraph mentions the numbers without specifying. However, since the reconciliation is in thousands, maybe the numbers given in the first paragraph are already in thousands. Wait, no—the first paragraph says \"exercisable shares excluded for 2019 and 2018 are 1,216,000 and 1,259,500, respectively.\" The term \"respectively\" here refers to 2019 and 2018. So each of those numbers is in thousands? Or not?\n\nWait, the second paragraph's reconciliation is in thousands, but the first paragraph's numbers might be in actual counts. However, the way it's written, the numbers are presented as 1,216,000 and 1,259,500. If they were in thousands, they would probably say so. But since the reconciliation is in thousands, perhaps the numbers in the first paragraph are also in thousands. But the problem is that the user is asking for the total number of shares excluded.

From the provided contexts, both the table and text mention the same details.

That's a significant portion. However, there's also a partial offset from an impairment of goodwill that isn't deductible for tax purposes. So, even though the goodwill impairment isn't tax-deductible, it still affected the overall benefit. \n\nThe Insurance segment's profitability in 2019 and its three-year cumulative income position likely played a role in releasing the valuation allowance. But the question specifically asks what drove the benefit, so the primary factor is the valuation allowance release. The impairment is a negative factor but doesn't directly drive the benefit; it reduces it. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the main driver is the release of the valuation allowance due to the Insurance segment's performance.

Under the \"Net income per share\" category, there are entries for Basic and Diluted.\n\nLooking at the Basic row, the value for 2018 is listed as 0.36.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants the percentage change in total accrued expenses between 2018 and 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to find the values for Total accrued expenses in both years. From the table provided, under \"Total accrued expenses,\" the 2019 value is 51180 and the 2018 value is 123652. Wait, but the note says all monetary amounts are in percentage. Hmm, that might be a bit confusing. But maybe it's just indicating that the numbers are percentages, so we can use them directly.\n\nThe formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. So plugging in the numbers: (51180 - 123652) / 123652 * 100. Let me calculate that. \n\nSubtracting 123652 - 51180 gives 72472. Then divide by 123652, which equals approximately 0.5865. Multiplying by 100 gives a percentage change of about -58.65%. Wait, negative because it decreased. Let me check if I did the subtraction right. Yes, 123652 minus 51180 is indeed 72472. So the decrease is 72472 over the original 123652, which is roughly 58.65% decrease. So the percentage change is -58.65%, but since the question asks for the percentage change, it's acceptable to present it as a negative number indicating a decrease. Alternatively, sometimes people refer to the absolute value, but the standard formula includes the sign. \n\nWait, but looking back, the problem says \"percentage change\", which typically includes the direction. So the answer should be a decrease of approximately 58.65%, so -58.65%. Let me verify once more. The old value is 2018's 123652, new is 2019's 51180. The difference is 51180 - 123652 = -72472.

The user is asking for the average income tax benefit for 2018 and 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table context provided. The table has rows related to Income tax benefit. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the value is listed as $(12,586) thousand USD, and the Value for 2018 is $(6,653) thousand USD. The % Change is 89%. \n\nWait, the % Change here might indicate the percentage change from 2018 to 2019. Let me check that. If the 2018 value is $(6,653) and the 2019 value is $(12,586), then the change would be calculated as ((New - Old)/Old)*100. Plugging in the numbers: ((12,586 - 6,653)/6,653)*100. That equals (5,933 / 6,653)*100 ≈ 89%, which matches the given % Change. So that checks out.\n\nBut the question is about the average income tax benefit for both years. The values given are for each year individually. The 2018 value is $(6,653) and 2019 is $(12,586). To find the average, I should add these two numbers and divide by 2. \n\nCalculating that: (6,653 + 12,586) / 2 = 19,239 / 2 = 9,619.5. Since all amounts are in thousands of USD, the average income tax benefit would be $9,619.5 thousand. But wait, the question says \"average income tax benefit,\" so maybe they want the average of the two years' benefits. However, looking back, the table lists the Income tax benefit for 2019 as $(12,586) and the Value for 2018 as $(6,653). So those are the two figures.

The table has columns named \"Deferred tax assets (Company - 2018)\", \"S$ Mil (Provisions)\", \"S$ Mil (Others)\", and \"S$ Mil (Total)\". But the question is about the two main items measured. \n\nLooking at the column names, it seems like the primary item is \"Deferred tax assets (Company - 2018)\" since that's the main category. Then, under that, there are subcategories: Provisions, Others, and Total. However, the question might be referring to the main categories rather than subcategories. \n\nWait, but the text mentions different rows like \"Balance as at 1 April 2017\", \"Effects of adoption...\", etc. Each of these rows has values under the columns. The columns themselves are Provisions, Others, and Total. But the main items could be the different time periods or events mentioned in the rows. For example, Balance as at certain dates, Effects of adoption, Credited to income statement, etc. \n\nBut the user says \"the 2 main items measured in this table\". The table's columns are Provisions, Others, Total. But maybe the main items are the different components of deferred tax assets. Wait, the first column is \"Deferred tax assets (Company - 2018)\", which might be the main item, and then the other columns are breakdowns. Alternatively, the main items could be the different line items like Provisions and Others. \n\nAlternatively, looking at the Text Context again, the columns are listed as Deferred tax assets (Company - 2018), S$ Mil (Provisions), S$ Mil (Others), S$ Mil (Total). So the main items here are the different parts of the deferred tax assets. The first column is the main category, and the others are subcomponents.

Or perhaps the two main components are Provisions and Others?\n\nWait, the problem states that the table has columns: Deferred tax assets (Company - 2018), S$ Mil (Provisions), S$ Mil (Others), S$ Mil (Total).

The user is asking for the Customer Support Revenues of Americas expressed as a percentage of GAAP-based Customer Support Gross Profit for Fiscal year 2019.\n\nFirst, I need to find the numbers from the table. Let me check the sections again. \n\nLooking at the \"Customer Support Revenues by Geography\" category, under Americas, the 2019 value is 57.6%. Wait, but that seems like a percentage already. However, the question is about Customer Support Revenues (which would be the numerator) divided by GAAP-based Gross Profit (the denominator). But maybe the percentages given here are the revenue breakdowns, not the actual values. Wait, the table has two parts: one with monetary amounts in thousands and another with percentages. \n\nWait, the first part of the text context lists various figures in thousands, like Americas 2019 is 718,209 (in thousands). Then there's a Category section with percentages. So the percentages under \"% Customer Support Revenues by Geography\" might be the proportion of total revenues each region contributes. For example, Americas' percentage is 57.6% in 2019. But the question isn't about the percentage of total revenues, but rather the Customer Support Revenues of Americas divided by GAAP-based Gross Profit. \n\nSo I need to get the actual dollar amount for Americas' Customer Support Revenues in 2019, which is 718,209 (thousands), and then divide that by the GAAP-based Gross Profit for 2019, which is 1,123,572 (thousands).

From the table:\n\nAmericas 2019 Customer Support Revenues: 718,209 (thousands)\nGAAP-based Gross Profit 2019: 1,123,572 (thousands)\n\nSo the calculation is (718,209 / 1,123,572) * 100.

Let me parse through the information carefully.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the values for FY18, which corresponds to the \"$'000 (30 June 2018)\" column. The notes mention different expense categories. \n\nLooking at each entry:\n\n1. **Finance costs**: The value for 2018 is a negative 54,897. Since it's negative, that might indicate a credit or a reduction, but depending on context, it could represent a cost. However, finance costs are typically interest expenses, which are usually positive figures. But here, it's negative, so maybe it's a refund or something else. Not sure yet.\n\n2. **Data centre rent paid to APDC**: For 2018, the value is \"-\". That means it's not available or not applicable. So we can't consider this as a valid figure.\n\n3. **APDC transaction costs**: The 2018 value is -5,459. Again, negative. This could be a credit or a reversal. But if it's included in professional fees, maybe it's a cost that was offset by some other factor.\n\n4. **Landholder duty on acquisition of APDC properties**: The 2018 value is -3,498. Another negative figure. This seems like a one-time expense related to acquiring properties, but the negative suggests perhaps a reimbursement or a contra-entry.\n\nNow, the key here is to determine which of these represents the largest expense. Since the question is about the \"most significant expense,\" we need to compare the absolute values of the negative numbers because they might represent actual cash outflows. Wait, but negative numbers in financial statements can sometimes mean credits or reductions. However, in some contexts, especially when dealing with expenses, a negative number might actually be a benefit, reducing the total expenses. But the user is asking for the most significant expense, so we need to find the largest amount that's an expense.\n\nWait, but looking at the Finance costs, the 2018 value is -54,897. If that's a negative number, does that mean the company had a gain or a reduction in finance costs? For example, if finance costs are normally an expense, a negative would imply that the actual",

The user is asking for the increase or decrease in the communication figures from 2018 to 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the correct data in the provided table context. The table mentions different categories like Communication, Consumer, Computer, Others, and Total. The relevant row here is \"For Communication: Value is 48.6, Years Ended December 31, is 45.2, Value is 52.2.\" \n\nWait, the way the data is structured might be a bit confusing. Let me parse it again. The columns are listed as \", , Years Ended December 31,, .\" So maybe the first value is for 2017, then Years Ended December 31 (which could be 2018?), and then the next value is 2019? But the text says \"For Application: Value is 2017, Years Ended December 31, is 2018, Value is 2019.\" Oh, that clarifies it. So each entry has three parts: the first Value is 2017, then the Years Ended December 31 (which corresponds to 2018), and the last Value is 2019.\n\nSo for Communication, the values are 48.6 (2017), 45.2 (2018), and 52.2 (2019). Wait, but the user is asking about the change from 2018 to 2019. So we need to take the 2018 value (45.2) and subtract it from the 2019 value (52.2). \n\nCalculating that: 52.2 - 45.2 = 7.0. So there's an increase of 7.0 percentage points. \n\nLet me double-check if I got the years right. The table's column headers mention \"Years Ended December 31,\" which is likely the year. The first Value is 2017, then the next part is 2018 (as per the Application line), and the last Value is 2019. Therefore, the Communication figure for 2018 is 45.2 and for 2019 is 52.2.",

The table has columns for 2019, 2018 (Year Ended December 31), and 2017, each with Grant Date Fair Value. \n\nUnder the RSAs Granted section, the 2019 Grant Date Fair Value is listed as 551214.

Let me check again.\n\nLooking at the text context, under RSAs Granted: 2019 is RSAs Granted, Grant Date Fair Value is 551214. Then 2018 (Year Ended December 31,) is 9.87, Grant Date Fair Value is 478210. Oh, so perhaps the numbers are split into two parts? Like the first part is the year, then the Grant Date Fair Value.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking about the impact of tax on the group share of associates' profits in 2018, specifically the percentage change. \n\nFirst, I need to find the relevant data from the table. The key here is to look for the \"Group share of associates' profits\" figures. The table has two entries related to this: one for pre-tax profits and another for post-tax profits.\n\nLooking at the \"Group share of associates' pre-tax profits\" row, the 2018 value is 1536, and the Change in constant currency is -37.6%. However, the question mentions \"post-tax\" profits, so I should check the corresponding post-tax entry. \n\nThe next entry under \"Group share of associates’ post-tax profits\" shows a 2018 value of 1383 with a Change in constant currency of -24.1%. But wait, the question is about the impact of tax, which would relate to the difference between pre-tax and post-tax. However, the exact wording is tricky. The user might be referring to the change in the post-tax figure due to tax effects. \n\nBut looking at the numbers, the pre-tax change is -37.6%, while the post-tax change is -24.1%. The difference between these two could indicate the tax impact. However, the question asks for the % change in 2018 due to tax. Alternatively, maybe they want the percentage change in the post-tax figure compared to pre-tax? Or perhaps the tax rate applied?\n\nWait, the problem states \"impact of tax on the group share of associates' profits in 2018, in terms of % change.\" So it's about how much the tax affected the profit, measured as a percentage change. If we consider that taxes reduce profits, the difference between pre-tax and post-tax profits would be the tax amount. But since the values given are percentages, not absolute numbers, we need to calculate the percentage change between pre-tax and post-tax profits for 2018.\n\nSo, the pre-tax profit in 2018 was 1536, and the post-tax was 1383. To find the impact of tax, we can compute the percentage change from pre-tax to post-tax. The formula is ((Post-tax - Pre-tax)/Pre-tax)*100. Plugging in the numbers: (1",

The user wants to know which non-returning director has the lowest total compensation. \n\nFirst, I need to understand what a non-returning director is. The table context mentions a category labeled \"Non-Returning Directors:(4).\" So, I should look for entries under that category.\n\nLooking through the data provided, the entries under Non-Returning Directors are Mary L Landrieu, Harvey P Perry, and Glen F Post, III. Let me check each of their totals.\n\nMary L Landrieu's total is 259,472. Harvey P Perry's total is 471,422. Glen F Post, III's total is 259,908. \n\nComparing these numbers: 259,472 (Landrieu) is lower than 259,908 (Post) and much lower than 471,422 (Perry). So the lowest is Mary L Landrieu. Wait, but wait—what about others? Let me make sure there aren't more non-returning directors listed. The text only lists those three under the Non-Returning category. \n\nSo yes, Mary L Landrieu has the lowest total compensation among them. But wait, looking back, the other directors not in the Non-Returning category might have lower totals? Wait no—the question specifically asks for non-returning directors. So even if someone else has a lower total, they're not in the Non-Returning group. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be Mary L Landrieu with 259,472. However, checking Glen F Post, III's total is 259,908, which is higher than Landrieu's. So yes, Landrieu is the correct answer.\n</think>\n\n<answer>Mary L Landrieu</answer>",

The user is asking for the increase or decrease in media revenue from 2017 to 2018. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table context provided. The table has several entries, and I need to find the relevant data for Media revenue. Scanning through the entries, there's a section under \"For Media:\" which mentions \"2018 FULL-YEAR RESULTS COMPARED TO 2017 is Media, Years ended December 31 is 2168, Years ended December 31 is 2153, Years ended December 31 is 1.\"\n\nWait, the structure here seems a bit confusing. Each entry has three values: the first is the category, then three sets of numbers. The first number might be the 2018 value, the second the 2017 value, and the third the change. Let me check that logic. For example, under Wireless, the numbers are 9200, 8569, 7. If we subtract 8569 from 9200, we get 631, but the third number is 7. That doesn't match. Hmm, maybe the third number is the percentage change? But 7 doesn't make sense as a percentage. Alternatively, perhaps the third number is the difference. Wait, 9200 - 8569 = 631 million. But the third value is 7. That doesn't align. Maybe the third number is the change in millions? But 9200 - 8569 is 631, not 7. So maybe my initial assumption is wrong.\n\nLooking further, under the \"Revenue\" section, the numbers are 15096, 14369, 5. Again, 15096 - 14369 = 727, but the third number is 5. This inconsistency suggests that maybe the third number isn't the absolute change but something else. However, the user is asking about the change in media revenue, so I need to focus on the Media row.\n\nIn the Media row, the numbers are 2168, 2153, 1. If these are the same pattern as other sections, then the third number would represent the change. But 216",

Wait, the first row mentions \"As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\" That might be a bit confusing. Let me parse that again.\n\nThe first row says \"As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\" Maybe that refers to the fiscal year ending December 31, 2019, but the value relates to 2018? Or perhaps there's a typo. But then looking at the next lines, under Projected benefit obligation, it says \"As of December 31, is 3778, Value is 3848.\" So maybe the \"Value\" column represents the actual number for that line item. \n\nWait, the user is asking for 2018. The first row mentions 2019 as the year-end but the value is 2018. However, the Projected benefit obligation line has \"As of December 31, is 3778, Value is 3848.\" So the \"Value\" here would be the figure for 2018? Because the first row's value is 2018, which might indicate that the data in the table is for the year 2018. Alternatively, maybe the \"As of December 31\" refers to the reporting date, and the \"Value\" is the year. For example, if the report is for the end of 2019, but the values are for 2018.

The user wants the percentage change in total net sales from 2018 to 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to find the correct numbers from the table. Looking at the Table Context, there's a row for \"Total Net Sales.\" The values mentioned are 85034000 for 2019, 77651000 for 2018, and 73948000 for 2017. Wait, but the question is about 2018 to 2019, so the relevant numbers should be 2019 and 2018.\n\nSo, the formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. Here, New Value is 2019's Total Net Sales (85,034,000) and Old Value is 2018's (77,651,000). \n\nCalculating the difference: 85,034,000 - 77,651,000 = 7,383,000. Then divide by 77,651,000: 7,383,000 / 77,651,000 ≈ 0.09507. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 9.507%. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 9.51%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers. The Total Net Sales for 2019 is 85,034,000 and 2018 is 77,651,000. Yes, that's right. So the calculation seems correct. The answer should be a 9.51% increase.\n</think>\n\n<answer>9.51%</answer>",

Yes, Bell Wireline is 3183 and BCE is 3988. \n\nDividing 3183 by 3988 gives approximately 0.798, which is 79.8%. Rounding to one decimal place, that's 80%. Wait, but maybe they want one decimal place as per the table's percentages. Let me confirm the exact division. \n\n3183 divided by 3988 equals roughly 0.798, so 79.8%. The answer should be 79.8%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>79.8%</answer>",

The user is asking for the percentage change in the net total between 2018 and 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to find the values for the total net in those two years. Looking at the table context, there's a row labeled \"Total, net\". For July 27, 2019 (which I assume is the end of 2019), the value is 10053. For July 28, 2018 (end of 2018), it's 9831. The increase (decrease) is listed as 222. But wait, the user wants the percentage change, so maybe I should calculate it using the actual numbers rather than relying on the provided increase.\n\nPercentage change formula is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value)*100. So plugging in the numbers: (10053 - 9831)/9831 * 100. Let me compute that. The difference is 222, which matches the Increase (Decrease) given. So 222 divided by 9831 equals approximately 0.02256, which is 2.256%. Rounding to two decimal places, that would be 2.26%. \n\nWait, but the question says \"percentage change\", and the table already provides the increase as 222. However, since the user might expect the calculation based on the actual figures, not the difference. But since the difference is exactly 222, either way, the percentage would be the same. So the answer is 2.26% increase. Let me confirm once again. Yes, 222/9831 is approximately 2.256%, so 2.26% when rounded to two decimal places. Alternatively, if they want one decimal place, maybe 2.3%, but the exact value depends on the required precision.

There's a paragraph mentioning that during the year ended December 31, 2019, the company decreased its valuation allowance by $12.8 million. That seems straightforward, but I should cross-verify with the table data to ensure accuracy.\n\nLooking at the table under \"Deferred income tax assets,\" there's a row for \"Less: valuation allowance\" with values for December 31, 2019, and 2018. The 2019 value is a negative 7653, and the 2018 value is a negative 20415. Wait, the numbers here are in thousands? The table might be using thousands as the unit, so the actual numbers would be these values multiplied by 1000. Let me calculate the difference between the two years. \n\nThe 2018 valuation allowance is -20,415 (thousands) and 2019 is -7,653 (thousands). The change would be the difference between these two. So, subtracting 2019 from 2018: (-7,653) - (-20,415) = 12,762 thousand dollars. That's $12,762,000. But the text says $12.8 million. Hmm, there's a slight discrepancy here. \n\nWait, maybe the table's numbers are in thousands, so 12,762 thousand is $12.762 million, which rounds to $12.8 million as stated in the text. That matches. Therefore, the correct answer is $12.8 million, as mentioned in the paragraph. The table supports this when considering the change in valuation allowance from 2018 to 2019.

So the formula for percentage change is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value)*100. Here, New Value is 2018's value (1058), Old Value is 2017's (1310). \n\nCalculating that: (1058 - 1310)/1310 * 100.

The total for 2019 is 482,449, which is the sum of all regions, including North America. But the specific North America value is clearly stated as 2259.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the change in revenue from South America between 2017 and 2018. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table context. The table has columns for the years 2019, 2018, and 2017. The rows are divided into regions: North America, Europe, Asia, South America, Other, and Total. \n\nThe question specifically mentions South America. Looking at the table entry for South America, the values for the years are as follows:\n- 2019: 232,394\n- 2018: 208,751\n- 2017: 212,616\n\nWait, but the user is asking for the change between 2017 and 2018, not 2018 and 2019. So I need to calculate the difference between the 2018 value and the 2017 value. \n\nSo subtracting 2017's value from 2018's: 208,751 - 212,616. Let me do that math. \n\n208,751 minus 212,616 equals... Hmm, that would be negative. Let me check again. Wait, 208,751 is less than 212,616. So the result is -3,865. But since the question asks for the \"change,\" it could be either absolute or the actual difference. However, typically, change implies the net difference, so it's 2018 minus 2017. \n\nBut maybe the user wants the absolute value? Or perhaps they just want the numerical difference. Let me confirm. The problem says \"change in revenue,\" which usually refers to the difference between the two periods. Since revenue decreased from 2017 to 2018, the change would be negative. However, sometimes people refer to change as the absolute amount. But given that the answer needs to be precise, I should present the exact figure. \n\nSo the calculation is 208,751 (2018) - 212,616 (2017)",

The table has columns with \"December 31\" and some values. The rows have entries like \"December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\" Wait, that seems a bit confusing. So for each row, there's a date (December 31) and then a year, like 2019, and then a value, which is 2018? Maybe the \"Value is 2018\" refers to the previous year?\n\nLooking at the rows, for example, under \"Land,\" December 31 is 11.9, Value is 11.9. But then for \"Property and equipment,\" December 31 is 345.5, Value is 309.6. The \"Value\" here might be the value from the prior year. So if the \"December 31\" column is the current year, then the \"Value\" column is the previous year. \n\nThe first row mentions \"December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\" That suggests that the data in the \"December 31\" column is for the year 2019, and the \"Value\" column is for 2018. Therefore, the table is showing the ending balances for 2019 and the beginning balances for 2018. \n\nSo the property and equipment line item shows a value of 345.5 million for December 31, 2019, and 309.6 million for the Value (which would be 2018). Therefore, the table provides information for the years 2018 and 2019. \n\nBut the question is asking which years the table provides information for the company's property and equipment. Since the \"Value\" column is the prior year, the data includes both the current year (2019) and the prior year (2018).

Or perhaps the first column is the date (December 31), then the year (2019), and the value (2018)? That doesn't make much sense.

Let me check the Row 1 data: it lists 2019, December 31, is 2018, Value is 2017. So perhaps each row has three entries: the first is the current year (like 2019), then the previous year (2018), and then the one before that (2017). \n\nSo for the Deferral of revenue row, the numbers would be 2019: 45040, 2018: 40003, 2017: 46193.

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the respective revenue from Asia Pacific in 2018 and 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the table context provided. The table has categories under \"Revenue by geography,\" and one of the rows is for Asia Pacific. The columns seem to be labeled with fiscal years, but the exact column headers aren't clear. However, looking at the row data for Asia Pacific, there are two values listed: 3049 and 4905, along with a Fiscal Years value of 5810. \n\nWait, the first row mentions \"Value is 2019, Value is 2018, Fiscal Years is 2017.\" That might mean the columns are ordered as 2019, 2018, then Fiscal Years. But that seems odd because the Fiscal Years would typically be the year itself. Maybe the third column is the total for that category across all fiscal years? Or perhaps it's a typo?\n\nLooking further, the Asia Pacific row has \"Value is 3049, Value is 4905, Fiscal Years is 5810.\" If we consider the first two values as 2019 and 2018, then 3049 would correspond to 2019 and 4905 to 2018. Wait, that doesn't make sense because usually, the latest year comes first. Alternatively, maybe the first value is 2018 and the second is 2019? Let me check other entries. For example, the Total revenue line has \"Value is 10310, Value is 12629, Fiscal Years is 12149.\" If these are for 2019 and 2018, then 10310 would be 2019 and 12629 would be 2018. But that would imply the total revenue in 2018 was higher than 2019, which might be possible. \n\nBut wait, the first row says \"Fiscal Years is 2017\" for the first entry. So maybe the columns are arranged as follows: the first Value is for 2019, the second Value is for 2018, and",

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the change in the provision for doubtful receivables between 2018 and 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data from the provided table context. The table has columns for December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018. The rows mention \"Less: provision for doubtful receivables.\" \n\nLooking at the numbers, for 2019, the provision is listed as a negative 16,377. For 2018, it's a negative 16,086. Wait, but provisions are usually positive amounts, right? Or maybe in this context, they're presented as negatives because they're subtracting from accounts receivable. So the actual values might be positive when considering their impact on the net amount.\n\nBut the question specifically asks about the change in the provision itself. So I should calculate the difference between the two years. Let me check the numbers again. \n\nIn 2018, the provision was -16,086 (thousands of USD), and in 2019, it's -16,377. To find the change, I subtract the 2018 value from the 2019 value. That would be (-16,377) - (-16,086) = -16,377 + 16,086 = -291. \n\nSo the provision decreased by 291 thousand USD. But wait, the question says \"change,\" which could be absolute or the numerical difference. Since the provision increased in magnitude (became more negative), that means the company wrote off more receivables in 2019 compared to 2018. However, the actual change in the provision's value is a decrease of 291 thousand. Alternatively, if they consider the absolute value, it's an increase of 291. But based on the numbers given, the mathematical change is -291. \n\nWait, but sometimes provisions are added back, so maybe the negative sign indicates a reduction. Let me think again. If the provision is a deduction from accounts receivable, then a higher negative number (more negative) would mean a larger provision, implying worse credit quality. So the provision increased by 2",
