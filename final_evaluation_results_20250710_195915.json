      "generated_answer": "<think> The user is asking for the total assets as of June 30, 2019. From the table context, there's a line item labeled \"Net deferred tax asset\" with values for 2019 and 2018. However, the term \"net deferred tax asset\" isn't typically considered part of total assets but rather a contra account affecting equity or liabilities. But given the structure here, perhaps the table is simplifying, using \"Net deferred tax asset\" as a proxy for total assets. Looking at the table rows: Row 20 shows \"Net deferred tax asset\" with June 30, 2019 value as 948,578 and 2018 as 1,042,791. The question is about 2019, so the 2019 value is 948,578. However, this might not be accurate because net deferred tax assets are usually separate from total assets. But since the question specifically refers to the table provided, and the only numerical entries under \"June 30, 2019\" are for \"Net deferred tax asset,\" it's likely that the answer is derived from that. Alternatively, checking other rows like \"Long-term assets\" which has 1,004,450 for 2019. Wait, the table includes \"Long-term assets\" as 1,004,450. That seems more plausible. So maybe the user intended to refer to \"Long-term assets\" as total assets. Let me check again. Wait, the table headers aren't entirely clear. The columns are labeled as \"June 30,\" but the rows have multiple entries. Looking at the text context, after the table, there's a mention of \"Table columns: , June 30,, .\" which suggests the columns are for different years, possibly 2019 and 2018. Then, looking at the rows: Row 1 data: June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018. That seems odd. Maybe the table is structured with two columns for each row, one for 2019 and one for 2018. For example, the first entry under \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\" might mean that the value for 2019 is 2018? That doesn't make sense. Wait, perhaps the table is misaligned. Let me parse the table correctly. Assuming the table has three columns: the first is the category, then June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2018. For example: Row 1: Category: Deferred tax assets. Then under June 30, 2019, Value is 2018. Wait, that can't be right. Because 2018 would be the prior year. Maybe the table is misformatted. Alternatively, perhaps the table is presented with the categories and their corresponding values for 2019 and 2018. For instance, the first row after the header could be \"Deferred tax assets\" with 2019 value 1,112,987 and 2018 value 1,219,725. Then \"Valuation allowance\" with 2019 value -77,328 and 2018 -80,924. Then \"Net deferred tax asset\" with 948,578and 1,042,791. Similarly, \"Long-term assets\" with 1,004,450and 1,122,729. Given that, the \"Long-term assets\" row has a value of 1,004,450 for 2019. That seems like a plausible candidate for total assets. Since the question is asking for total assets as of June 30, 2019, and the table lists \"Long-term assets\" with 2019 value 1,004,450, that must be the answer. The other entries like \"Net deferred tax asset\" are components contributing to equity or liabilities, not total assets. Therefore, the correct answer is 1,004,450 thousand dollars, which would be written as 1004450. </think> <answer> 1004450 </answer>ã€‚",

      "query": "What are the Fiscal years included in the table?",
      "expected_answer": "2019; 2018",
      "generated_answer": "<think> The user is asking for the fiscal years included in the table. To determine this, we need to look at the data presented in the table rows and cross-reference it with the textual context provided. First, let's examine the table structure. Each row has entries under categories like \"Deferred tax assets,\" \"Deferred tax liabilities,\" etc. The first column seems to indicate the category, and subsequent columns likely represent different line items or values. However, the headers for the columns aren't explicitly listed in the text, but the initial mention says: \"Table columns: , June 30,, .\" This suggests that the columns might correspond to dates or fiscal years. Given that the table includes entries like \"June 30, is [year],\" it's reasonable to infer that the columns represent fiscal years ending on those dates. Looking at the rows: Row 1: June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018. This could mean that the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2019, and the corresponding value is for 2018. Wait, that seems contradictory. If the fiscal year ends in June 2019, the value would typically reflect the period up to that date, but the label here says \"Value is 2018.\" That might be a formatting error or a misalignment between the labels and the actual data. Alternatively, perhaps the \"Value\" column represents the fiscal year 2018, while the \"June 30, is 2019\" indicates the end date of the fiscal year. But this is confusing because fiscal years often span multiple months, not just one day. Wait, looking back at the table context provided, there's a row labeled \"Row 20 data: June 30, is 948578, Value is 1042791.\" Then, in the text context below, there are entries like \"For Non-capital loss carryforwards: June 30, is 161119, Value is 129436.\" Similarly, \"For Capital loss carryforwards: June 30, is 155, Value is 417.\" These all have \"June 30, is [number], Value is [number].\" It appears that each entry under the table corresponds to a fiscal year-end dateand a value related to that fiscal year. However, the user is asking for the fiscal years included in the table. The key here is to identify the range of fiscal years covered. Let's parse through the data again. In the table rows, many entries start with \"June 30, is [year]\" where [year] is a four-digit number. For example, \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". Then, looking at the text context, there are entries like \"For Non-capital loss carryforwards: June 30, is 161119, Value is 129436.\" The \"June 30, is [number]\" likely refers to the fiscal year-end date, and the \"Value\" is the corresponding value for that fiscal year. But wait, the first rowhas \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018.\" That seems inconsistent because if the fiscal year ends on June 30, 2019, the value should relate to that year. However, the value is labeled as 2018. This discrepancy needs clarification. Perhaps the \"Value\" column represents the fiscal year 2018, even though the end date is June 30, 2019. That would imply that the fiscal year 2018 ended on June 30, 2019. Alternatively, maybe the \"June 30, is [year]\" is the fiscal year-end, and the \"Value\" is the value for that fiscal year. So, for example, the fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, had a value of 2018. Alternatively, perhaps the \"June 30, is [year]\" is a typo or formatting error. Maybe it's supposed to be \"June 30, [year]\" indicating the fiscal year that ends on that date. For instance, fiscal year 2019 ends on June 30, 2019. Then, the \"Value\" would be the amount for that fiscal year. But in the first row, \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\" would suggest that the fiscal year 2019 ended on June 30, 2019, and its value is 2018. But that would mean the fiscal year 2019's value is 2018, which might not align with standard accounting practices unless there's a reason for that. This confusion arises from the way the table is structured. The headers aren't explicitly given, so we have to infer based on the data. Given that the table includes entries like \"June 30, is [year]\", it's logical to assume that these refer to fiscal years ending on those dates. For example, fiscal year 2019 ended on June 30, 2019, and the corresponding value is 2018. Similarly, another entry might be for fiscal year 2018 ending on June 30, 2018, with a value of X. However, the first row shows \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". If the fiscal year ended on June 30, 2019, then the value should be for that fiscal year. But why is the value labeled as 2018? That might be a mistake in the data entry. Alternatively, perhaps the \"Value\" column represents the fiscal year 2018, and the \"June 30, is 2019\" is a typo, meaning fiscal year 2019. But this is unclear. Another approach is to look at the last row of the table provided in the text context. The last row is \"For Net deferred tax asset: June 30, is 948578, Value is 1042791.\" Following the same pattern, this would be the fiscal year ending on June 30, with the respective values. Given that the table includes entries for multiple fiscal years, the fiscal years included would be the ones ending on June 30 for each year listed. For example, if there's a row for June 30, 2019, that implies fiscal year 2019, and another for June 30, 2018, implying fiscal year 2018. But the first row in the tablehas \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". This could mean that the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2019, had a value of 2018. Similarly, another row might have \"June 30, is 2018, Value is X\", indicating fiscal year 2018. However, the user is asking for the fiscal years included in the table. To determine this, we need to list all the fiscal years represented in the table. From the data provided, the fiscal years would be those ending on June 30 for each year present in the table. For example, if the table includes entries for June 30, 2019, June 30, 2018, June 30, 2017, etc., then the fiscal years included would be 2019, 2018, 2017, etc. But since the table isn't fully provided here, we can only go by the examples given. The first row mentions \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\", which might be a fiscal year 2019. Another row might be \"June 30, is 2018, Value is Y\", which would be fiscal year 2018. Similarly, \"June 30, is 2017, Value is Z\" would be fiscal year 2017. Therefore, the fiscal years included in the table would be 2019, 2018, 2017, etc., depending on how many rows are in the table. However, the problem is that the table isn't entirely shown here. The user provided a snippet of the table context, including some rows and their data. From the given data, the first rowhas \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". The second rowhas \"June 30, is 948578, Value is 1042791\". There are also several other rows in the text context, such as: For Non-capital loss carryforwards: June 30, is 161119, Value is 129436. For Capital loss carryforwards: June 30, is 155, Value is 417. For Undeducted scientific research and development expenses: June 30, is 137253, Value is 123114. For Depreciation and amortization: June 30, is 683777, Value is 829369. And others... Each of these entries starts with \"June 30, is [number], Value is [number]\". The numbers before \"is\" likely represent the fiscal year-end date, and the numbers after \"Value is\" represent the corresponding value for that fiscal year. Assuming that each of these entries corresponds to a different fiscal year, the fiscal years included would be the set of all unique fiscal years represented in the table. However, without knowing the exact number of rows and the full extent of the table, we can only infer based on the provided snippets. Looking at the first entry: \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". If this is fiscal year 2019, then the value is 2018. Similarly, another entry might be \"June 30, is 2018, Value is X\", which would be fiscal year 2018. But the user is asking for the fiscal years included in the table. Based on the available data, the fiscal years would be the ones ending on June 30 for each year present in the table. However, the first entry has a fiscal year ending in 2019 with a value of 2018, which might indicate that the fiscal year 2019 ended on June 30, 2019, and the value is 2018. Similarly, another entry might have \"June 30, is 2018, Value is Y\", implying fiscal year 2018. But this is speculative. To confirm, we need to check if there are multiple fiscal years represented. For example, if the table includes entries for both 2019 and 2018, then the fiscal years included are 2019 and 2018. However, the first entry is \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\", which could be a fiscal year 2019 with a value of 2018. If there were another entry like \"June 30, is 2018, Value is X\", that would be fiscal year 2018. But the problem is that the table isn't fully provided here. The user provided a snippet of the table context, which includes several rows. Without the full table, we can only work with the given data. Given that the first row has \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\", and assuming that this is a fiscal year 2019, then the fiscal year included would be 2019. However, if there are other entries with different years, then multiple fiscal years are included. But the user is asking for the fiscal years included in the table. Since the table includes entries for multiple fiscal years, the answer would be the set of all fiscal years represented in the table. However, without the full table, we can't list all of them. Alternatively, perhaps the fiscal years are consecutive, starting from 2017 to 2019, based on the examples given. For instance, if the table includes entries for 2019, 2018, and 2017, then the fiscal years included are 2019, 2018, and 2017. But again, this is speculative. To resolve this ambiguity, we need to consider the context provided. The text mentions \"fiscal year 2019\" and \"prior year\"in the table. For example, the first row has \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". This could mean that the fiscal year ending on June 30, 2019, had a value of 2018. Similarly, another entry might be \"June 30, is 2018, Value is X\", which would be fiscal year 2018. If we assume that the table includes entries for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and possibly 2017, then the fiscal years included are 2019, 2018, and 2017. However, without more data, we can't be certain. But the user is asking for the fiscal years included in the table. Given that the table includes entries for multiple fiscal years, the answer would be the set of all fiscal years represented in the table. However, since the table isn't fully provided, we can only state what's evident from the given data. In conclusion, based on the provided data, the fiscal years included in the table are 2019, 2018, and potentially others. However, the exact set depends on the full table structure. Given the limited information, the safest assumption is that the fiscal years included are 2019 and 2018, as these are the two years explicitly mentioned in the first two rows of the table. Thus, the answer would be that the fiscal years included in the table are 2019 and 2018. </think> <answer> n To determine the fiscal years included in the table, we analyze the data provided in the context.

      "query": "What is the average annual total assets for both Fiscal years?",
      "expected_answer": "995684.5",
      "generated_answer": "<think> To calculate the average annual total assets for both fiscal years, we need to identify the total assets figures for each year and then compute their average. First, locate the relevant line items in the table. The term \"total assets\" isn't explicitly mentioned here, but given the context of deferred tax assets and liabilities, it's reasonable to infer that \"Net deferred tax asset\" might serve as a proxy for total assets in this specific table. However, looking at the table rows: The \"Total deferred tax asset\" for June 30, 2019, is listed as 1,112,987. The \"Net deferred tax asset\" for June 30, 2019, is 948,578. Wait, there seems to be a discrepancy here. The \"Total deferred tax asset\" includes valuation allowance and other components, while \"Net deferred tax asset\" subtracts the valuation allowance. But the question is about \"total assets,\" not specifically deferred tax assets. Since the table doesn't directly mention \"total assets,\" perhaps the \"Long-term assets\" row could be considered. Let me check: Looking at the table again, under the categories, there's a row labeled \"Long-term assets\" with values for June 30, 2019, as 1,004,450. That might be a better candidate for total assets. Alternatively, \"Long-term liabilities\" are negative, so they would reduce equity rather than assets. Alternatively, maybe the \"Net deferred tax asset\" is being used as a placeholder for total assets in this table. Given that the question refers to \"total assets,\" and the table has entries like \"Total deferred tax asset\" and \"Net deferred tax asset,\" but no explicit \"total assets\" line, this could be a case where the user expects us to use the available data despite potential misalignment. Assuming that \"Net deferred tax asset\" is intended to represent total assets, even though that might not be accurate in real accounting terms. The other lines like long-term assets might be part of the balance sheet but aren't labeled as such in the table. Given the ambiguity, proceed with the available data. The table shows two fiscal yearswith values for \"Net deferred tax asset.\" For 2019, the value is 948,578, and for 2018, it's 1,042,791. Wait, waitâ€”looking back at the table data: Row 1 data: June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018. Then, for \"Net deferred tax asset,\" June 30, is 948,578, Value is 1,042,791. Wait, that can't be right. Wait, the table headers are a bit confusing. The table columns are labeled as \"June 30,\" with two entries: one for 2019 and one for 2018. So, the \"June 30, is 2019\" column likely corresponds to 2019, and \"Value is 2018\" probably indicates the value for 2018. Wait, but the way the table is structured might have the first column as the category, then the next two columns as the years. Let me parse the table correctly. Looking at the table structure again: The table has three columns after the initial identifier. The headers are: \"Year | Cost of Net Revenue\" but the actual headers seem to be missing. Wait, the user provided the table context as: Table ID: b3d63fb06110ad7e91c9e765227c1d27 Table columns: , June 30,, . Row 1 data: June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018. Then, various rows with data. This suggests that the table has three columns: the first is empty, the second is \"June 30,\" indicating the date, the third is the value. So, the table is structured as follows: Column 1: CategoryColumn 2: June 30, 2019 value Column 3: June 30, 2018 value Wait, but in the first row, \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\"â€”this might be a formatting error. It's more likely that the table has two columns: the first is the description, and the next two columns are the values for 2019 and 2018 respectively. So, the headers might be mislabeled. Let me re-express the table: Assuming the table has three columns: Description, 2019, 2018. Then: Row 1: Description: \"Deferred tax assets\". Wait, this is conflicting because \"June 30, is 2019\" would imply that the entire row is for 2019, but the next entry is \"Value is 2018\". This is inconsistent. Perhaps the table is misaligned. Let me parse it differently. Looking at the text context provided: After the table ID, the text says: Table columns: , June 30,, . Then lists rows with data. For example: Row 1 data: June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018. Row 20 data: June 30, is 948578, Value is 1042791. This suggests that the table has three columns: the first is the description, the second is the 2019 value, and the third is the 2018 value. Therefore, the headers are: Column 1: Description Column 2: 2019 Column 3: 2018 Thus, the table is structured as: Description | 2019 | 2018 But the first rowhas \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". Wait, this might be a mistake. Maybe the first row is a header row indicating the years. But the way it's written is unclear. Let me assume that the first row is a header row with the descriptions, and subsequent rows have the data. Wait, the first row says \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". This seems to indicate that the first column is \"June 30, 2019\" and \"Value is 2018\", but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, perhaps the table is misformatted, and the actual headers are missing. Given that the user provided the table context, let's try to parse it correctly. Assuming the table has three columns: Description, 2019, 2018. Then: Row 1: Description: \"Deferred tax assets\" Row 2: Description: \"Deferred tax liabilities\" Row 3: Description: \"Comprised of:\" ... Row 20: Description: \"Net deferred tax asset\" Then, the data for each row would be in the next columns. However, the first rowhas \"June 30, is 2019, Value is 2018\". This might be a typo or formatting error. It's possible that the first row is supposed to be headers, but due to formatting issues, it's incorrectly placed. Alternatively, the table might have merged cells or different alignments. Given the confusion, perhaps the correct approach is to look for the \"Net deferred tax asset\" row and extract the 2019 and 2018 values. From the text context: \"For Net deferred tax asset: June 30, is 948578, Value is 1042791.\" Assuming that \"June 30, is 948578\" refers to the 2019 value and \"Value is 1042791\" refers to 2018. Therefore, the 2019 value is 948,578 and 2018 is 1,042,791. Wait, but earlier in the table, another row had \"June 30, is 1112987, Value is 1219725\" for \"Total deferred tax asset\". So, the same pattern applies: the first number is the 2019 value, and the second is 2018. Therefore, the \"Net deferred tax asset\" for 2019 is 948,578 and 2018 is 1,042,791. However, this might not be the correct interpretation. Because \"Net deferred tax asset\" is calculated by subtracting the valuation allowance from the total deferred tax asset. So, the \"Total deferred tax asset\" is 1,112,987and 1,219,725, and the \"Net deferred tax asset\" is 948,578and 1,042,791. But the question is about \"total assets,\" which isn't directly present in the table. Given that the table is about deferred tax assets and liabilities, and assuming that \"Net deferred tax asset\" is intended to represent total assets, we can proceed with those numbers. Alternatively, looking at the other rows, like \"Long-term assets\" with 1,004,450and 1,122,729. But the problem is that the table doesn't explicitly state whether these are assets or liabilities. The \"Long-term liabilities\" are negative, which would reduce equity, not assets. Given the ambiguity, but since the question references the table provided, and the only numerical data points are in the \"Net deferred tax asset\" and possibly \"Long-term assets,\" we need to decide which to use. If we take \"Net deferred tax asset\" as the total assets, then the average would be/2. But this might not be accurate. Alternatively, if we consider \"Long-term assets\" as total assets, then the values are 1,004,450and 1,122,729. Let's check both possibilities: Using \"Net deferred tax asset\": 2019: 948,578 2018: 1,042,791 Average =/2 = 1,991,369 / 2 = 995,684.5 Using \"Long-term assets\": 2019: 1,004,450 2018: 1,122,729 Average =/2 = 2,127,179 / 2 = 1,063,589.5 However, the question is about \"total assets,\" which typically include all assets, not just deferred tax assets or long-term assets. In standard financial statements, \"total assets\" would encompass all assets, including current and non-current. But given the table provided, it's unclear what exactly constitutes \"total assets\" here. Since the table does not explicitly list \"total assets,\" but only \"deferred tax assets\" and related items, and the user is referring to the table context, we must rely on the available data. The safest assumption is that the user intends to use the \"Net deferred tax asset\" as a proxy for total assets, even though this may not align with real-world accounting standards. Therefore, using the \"Net deferred tax asset\" values: 2019: 948,578 2018: 1,042,791 Average =/2 = 1,991,369 / 2 = 995,684.5 Alternatively, if using \"Long-term assets\": Average =/2 = 2,127,179 / 2 = 1,063,589.5 But the question specifies \"total assets,\" which would be broader. However, given the table's focus on deferred tax assets, it's unclear. To resolve this, perhaps the user made a mistake in the question, intending to refer to deferred tax assets instead of total assets. Assuming that \"total assets\" here refers to the \"Net deferred tax asset,\" the average would be approximately 995,684.5. Rounded to the nearest whole number, 995,685. Alternatively, if considering \"Long-term assets\" as total assets, the average would be 1,063,589.5. But since the question is about \"total assets,\" and the table doesn't provide a direct line item for that, this is speculative. However, given the context and the available data, the best approach is to use the \"Net deferred tax asset\" values as the closest proxy.

      "extracted_answer": "948578 and for 2018 it's 1042791. Wait waitâ€”looking back at the table data: Row 1 data: June 30 is 2019 Value is 2018. Then for \"Net deferred tax asset\" June 30 is 948578 Value is 1042791. Wait that can't be right. Wait the table headers are a bit confusing. The table columns are labeled as \"June 30\" with two entries: one for 2019 and one for 2018. So the \"June 30 is 2019\" column likely corresponds to 2019 and \"Value is 2018\" probably indicates the value for 2018. Wait but the way the table is structured might have the first column as the category then the next two columns as the years. Let me parse the table correctly. Looking at the table structure again: The table has three columns after the initial identifier. The headers are: \"Year | Cost of Net Revenue\" but the actual headers seem to be missing. Wait the user provided the table context as: Table ID: b3d63fb06110ad7e91c9e765227c1d27 Table columns:  June 30 . Row 1 data: June 30 is 2019 Value is 2018. Then various rows with data. This suggests that the table has three columns: the first is empty the second is \"June 30\" indicating the date the third is the value. So the table is structured as follows: Column 1: CategoryColumn 2: June 30 2019 value Column 3: June 30 2018 value Wait but in the first row \"June 30 is 2019 Value is 2018\"â€”this might be a formatting error. It's more likely that the table has two columns: the first is the description and the next two columns are the values for 2019 and 2018 respectively. So the headers might be mislabeled. Let me re-express the table: Assuming the table has three columns: Description 2019 2018. Then: Row 1: Description: \"Deferred tax assets\". Wait this is conflicting because \"June 30 is 2019\" would imply that the entire row is for 2019 but the next entry is \"Value is 2018\". This is inconsistent. Perhaps the table is misaligned. Let me parse it differently. Looking at the text context provided: After the table ID the text says: Table columns:  June 30 . Then lists rows with data. For example: Row 1 data: June 30 is 2019 Value is 2018. Row 20 data: June 30 is 948578 Value is 1042791. This suggests that the table has three columns: the first is the description the second is the 2019 value and the third is the 2018 value. Therefore the headers are: Column 1: Description Column 2: 2019 Column 3: 2018 Thus the table is structured as: Description | 2019 | 2018 But the first rowhas \"June 30 is 2019 Value is 2018\". Wait this might be a mistake. Maybe the first row is a header row indicating the years. But the way it's written is unclear. Let me assume that the first row is a header row with the descriptions and subsequent rows have the data. Wait the first row says \"June 30 is 2019 Value is 2018\". This seems to indicate that the first column is \"June 30 2019\" and \"Value is 2018\" but that doesn't make sense. Alternatively perhaps the table is misformatted and the actual headers are missing. Given that the user provided the table context let's try to parse it correctly. Assuming the table has three columns: Description 2019 2018. Then: Row 1: Description: \"Deferred tax assets\" Row 2: Description: \"Deferred tax liabilities\" Row 3: Description: \"Comprised of:\" ... Row 20: Description: \"Net deferred tax asset\" Then the data for each row would be in the next columns. However the first rowhas \"June 30 is 2019 Value is 2018\". This might be a typo or formatting error. It's possible that the first row is supposed to be headers but due to formatting issues it's incorrectly placed. Alternatively the table might have merged cells or different alignments. Given the confusion perhaps the correct approach is to look for the \"Net deferred tax asset\" row and extract the 2019 and 2018 values. From the text context: \"For Net deferred tax asset: June 30 is 948578 Value is 1042791.\" Assuming that \"June 30 is 948578\" refers to the 2019 value and \"Value is 1042791\" refers to 2018. Therefore the 2019 value is 948578 and 2018 is 1042791. Wait but earlier in the table another row had \"June 30 is 1112987 Value is 1219725\" for \"Total deferred tax asset\". So the same pattern applies: the first number is the 2019 value and the second is 2018. Therefore the \"Net deferred tax asset\" for 2019 is 948578 and 2018 is 1042791. However this might not be the correct interpretation. Because \"Net deferred tax asset\" is calculated by subtracting the valuation allowance from the total deferred tax asset. So the \"Total deferred tax asset\" is 1112987and 1219725 and the \"Net deferred tax asset\" is 948578and 1042791. But the question is about \"total assets\" which isn't directly present in the table. Given that the table is about deferred tax assets and liabilities and assuming that \"Net deferred tax asset\" is intended to represent total assets we can proceed with those numbers. Alternatively looking at the other rows like \"Long-term assets\" with 1004450and 1122729. But the problem is that the table doesn't explicitly state whether these are assets or liabilities. The \"Long-term liabilities\" are negative which would reduce equity not assets. Given the ambiguity but since the question references the table provided and the only numerical data points are in the \"Net deferred tax asset\" and possibly \"Long-term assets\" we need to decide which to use. If we take \"Net deferred tax asset\" as the total assets then the average would be/2. But this might not be accurate. Alternatively if we consider \"Long-term assets\" as total assets then the values are 1004450and 1122729. Let's check both possibilities: Using \"Net deferred tax asset\": 2019: 948578 2018: 1042791 Average =/2 = 1991369 / 2 = 995684.5 Using \"Long-term assets\": 2019: 1004450 2018: 1122729 Average =/2 = 2127179 / 2 = 1063589.5 However the question is about \"total assets\" which typically include all assets not just deferred tax assets or long-term assets. In standard financial statements \"total assets\" would encompass all assets including current and non-current. But given the table provided it's unclear what exactly constitutes \"total assets\" here. Since the table does not explicitly list \"total assets\" but only \"deferred tax assets\" and related items and the user is referring to the table context we must rely on the available data. The safest assumption is that the user intends to use the \"Net deferred tax asset\" as a proxy for total assets even though this may not align with real-world accounting standards.

      "generated_answer": "<think> To determine the percentage change in total assets from fiscal year 2018 to 2019, we need to identify the relevant values for each year. In the provided table, the \"Net deferred tax asset\" is listed under the category \"Deferred tax assets.\" However, it's important to note that \"net deferred tax asset\" typically represents the net amount after considering valuation allowances and other adjustments, not the total assets themselves. Looking at the table rows: For \"Net deferred tax asset,\" the June 30, 2019 value is 948,578, and the June 30, 2018 value is 1,042,791. These figures are presented in thousands, as indicated by the table headers. Assuming that the \"Net deferred tax asset\" here is being used as a proxy for \"total assets\", we can calculate the percentage change using these values. The formula for percentage change is: [/Old Value] * 100. Plugging in the numbers: [/1,042,791] 100 â‰ˆ [/1,042,791] 100 â‰ˆ -9.03%. This indicates a decrease of approximately 9.03% in the net deferred tax assetfrom 2018 to 2019. However, it's critical to verify whether \"Net deferred tax asset\" is indeed equivalent to \"total assets\" in this context. Typically, total assets would encompass all tangible and intangible assets, whereas deferred tax assets are specific to tax-related accounts. Therefore, there might be a discrepancy if the table uses \"Net deferred tax asset\" as a stand-in for total assets. Given the information provided, the calculation assumes that the table's \"Net deferred tax asset\" corresponds to the requested \"total assets,\" even though this may not align with standard accounting terminology.

      "query": "What is the ratio of total current assets balance, as reported, to total current liabilities balance, as reported?",
      "expected_answer": "3.61",
      "generated_answer": "<think> To determine the ratio of total current assets balanceto total current liabilities balance, we need to extract the relevant figures from the provided table and text context. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step breakdown: ### Step 1: Identify Current AssetsFrom the table, the \"Current assets\" column lists various line items under their respective categories. We need to sum all these values to get the total current assets balance as reported. #### Key Entries: Receivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts: As Reported = 831.7 Adjustments = +8.7 Balance without adoption = 840.4 Inventories: As Reported = 1571.7 Adjustments = -3.1 Balance without adoption = 1568.6 Prepaid expenses and other current assets: As Reported = 93.8 Adjustments = -16.6 Balance without adoption = 77.2 Other accrued liabilities: As Reported = 691.6 Adjustments = -1.1 Balance without adoption = 690.5 Other noncurrent liabilities: As Reported = 1951.8 Adjustments = -2.5 Balance without adoption = 1949.3 However, note that \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" is labeled under \"Current liabilities,\" but since the question specifies \"current assets,\" we only consider entries under \"Current assets\" in the table. The \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" row seems to be a typo or mislabeling, as itâ€™s categorized under current assets but labeled as noncurrent. However, given the context, itâ€™s likely a formatting error, and the correct categorization would place \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" under liabilities, not assets. Therefore, we exclude this entry when calculating current assets. ### Step 2: Sum All Current AssetsAdding up the \"As Reported\" values for each current asset category: [ begin{align*} &= 831.7 &= 1571.7 &= 93.8 &= 691.6 end{align*} ] Total Current Assets=Calculating step-by-step: [ 7 + 1571.7 = 2403.4 4 + 93.8 = 2497.2 2 + 691.6 = 3188.8 quad] ### Step 3: Identify Total Current LiabilitiesLooking at the table again, the \"Current liabilities\" section includes entries like \"Other accrued liabilities\" and possibly others. However, the table structure might not explicitly list current liabilities separately. Instead, we look for entries under \"Current assets\" that could represent liabilities. Wait, noâ€”the table headers mention \"Current assets,\" \"Adjustments,\" and \"Balances without adoption.\" Thereâ€™s a discrepancy here because liabilities arenâ€™t directly listed under \"Current assets.\" Wait, perhaps thereâ€™s a mistake in the table interpretation. Let me re-examine the provided data: The table rows are structured as follows: For Receivables, less allowance... For Inventories... For Prepaid expenses... For Other accrued liabilities... For Other noncurrent liabilities... But the headers are \"Current assets,\" \"As Reported,\" \"Adjustments,\" \"Balances without...\"â€”this suggests that the table is about adjusting current assets balances. Each line item under \"Current assets\" has an \"As Reported\" value, adjustments, and then a balance without adopting certain accounting standards. However, the question asks for the ratio of total current assets balanceto total current liabilities balance. But the table doesn't explicitly list current liabilities; instead, it lists components contributing to current assets. This implies that the table might be part of the notes explaining adjustments to current assets, not liabilities. Given this confusion, perhaps the intended approach is to treat the \"As Reported\" values of the current asset line items as the numeratorand find the denominatorelsewhere. However, the problem statement doesnâ€™t provide a separate table for liabilities. Alternatively, maybe the \"Other accrued liabilities\" line is a liability, but itâ€™s listed under \"Current assets\"â€”this seems inconsistent. Wait, looking back at the table description: The table is titled \"Table ID: dc9d58a4e24a74d52f719372c1a16e7f\" with headers \"Current assets,\" \"As Reported,\" \"Adjustments,\" \"Balances without...\"â€”so itâ€™s about adjusting current assets. Therefore, the \"Other accrued liabilities\" might actually be a component of current liabilities, but incorrectly placed under current assets. This is a critical point. If the table is supposed to show adjustments to current assets, then the \"Other accrued liabilities\" might be a typo and should be under liabilities. But since the table is presented as part of the current assets discussion, perhaps the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is indeed a current asset. That would be unusual because accrued liabilities are typically liabilities. This inconsistency needs resolving. Alternatively, perhaps the table is structured such that each line item under \"Current assets\" represents different components of current assets, and the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a positive adjustment to current assets. But that doesnâ€™t make sense because accrued liabilities are liabilities, not assets. This is a potential error in the table presentation. Given that the question is about the ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities, and the table doesnâ€™t provide a separate liabilities schedule, we must infer. Assuming that the table is correctly structured and the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a current asset, we proceed with the calculation. Otherwise, we canâ€™t compute the ratio unless we assume that the entire table pertains to current assets, which may not be accurate. Given the ambiguity, Iâ€™ll proceed under the assumption that the table is about current assets adjustments, and the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a positive adjustment to current assets. This is speculative, but given the available data, we have to work with whatâ€™s provided. Thus, treating \"Other accrued liabilities\" as a current asset component, we add it to the total current assets. Then, assuming total current liabilities equal the sum of all liabilities, but since none are listed, perhaps the ratio is against some other figure. Wait, the question is about the ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities. If liabilities arenâ€™t provided, how can we compute this? This suggests a missing piece of information. However, given the context provided, perhaps the intended answer is to take the total current assetsdivided by a hypothetical total current liabilities derived from the same table. But thatâ€™s unclear. Alternatively, maybe the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a liability, and the table is mislabeled. If we consider that \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a liability, then total current liabilities would be higher. But without explicit liability figures, we canâ€™t compute accurately. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the safest approach is to state that the required data isnâ€™t fully present in the provided context, but proceed with the available numbers. Assuming that the table only contains current assets and the question intends to use the \"Other accrued liabilities\" as part of current assets, we proceed: Total Current Assets = 3188.8 million Total Current Liabilities = Assume \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a liability, but since itâ€™s under current assets, perhaps itâ€™s a positive adjustment. Wait, the \"Other accrued liabilities\" line shows As Reported = 691.6. If this is a liability, then total liabilities would be higher. But without other liabilities, we canâ€™t compute. Alternatively, perhaps the table is structured such that \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a negative adjustment to current assets. Looking at the table: For Other accrued liabilities: Current assets is Other accrued liabilities, As Reported is 691.6, Adjustments is a negative 1.1, Balances without adoption is 690.5. This suggests that the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is subtractedto arrive at the balance without adoption. So, the actual current asset value after adjustment is 690.5. But why is it under current assets? This is confusing. If \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a liability, then it shouldnâ€™t be under current assets. This is a critical issue. Given that the table is part of the notes to consolidated financial statements, and the question is about the ratio of current assets to current liabilities, but the table doesnâ€™t list liabilities, this is problematic. However, considering the context provided, perhaps the table is meant to adjust current assets, and the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a positive adjustment to current assets. This would mean that the actual current assets are higher than reported, but this contradicts standard accounting principles. Alternatively, maybe the table is showing the effect of adopting new accounting standards, hence the \"Balances without adoption\" column. The \"Other accrued liabilities\" adjustment is a negative 1.1, meaning that adopting the new standard reduces the current assets by 1.1 million. But the question is about the ratio of total current assetsto total current liabilities. Without knowing the actual current liabilities, we canâ€™t compute this ratio. Given the ambiguity, perhaps the intended answer is to ignore the liabilities and focus solely on the current assets. But the question explicitly mentions both numerator and denominator. Alternatively, maybe the table is incomplete, and the user expects us to use the provided current assets and assume that the liabilities are zero or another value. But this is unrealistic. Wait, looking back at the table description: The table is titled \"Table ID: dc9d58a4e24a74d52f719372c1a16e7f\" with headers \"Current assets,\" \"As Reported,\" \"Adjustments,\" \"Balances without...\"â€”so itâ€™s about adjusting current assets. Therefore, the \"Other accrued liabilities\" might be a typo and should be under liabilities. But since itâ€™s listed under current assets, perhaps itâ€™s a mistake. Alternatively, maybe the table is structured such that each line item under \"Current assets\" is a separate component, and the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a positive adjustment to current assets. This would imply that the company added a liability account to their current assets, which is nonsensical. Given the confusion, I must conclude that either the table is misformatted, or the question is designed to test attention to detail despite inconsistencies. Since the user provided the table and asked for the ratio, we must proceed with the available data, even if it leads to an unconventional result. Assuming that the table only contains current assets and the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a positive adjustment to current assets, we calculate: Total Current Assets = 3188.8 million Total Current Liabilities = Assume liabilities are zero or another value. But without data, this is impossible. Alternatively, if we consider that the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a liability, then total liabilities would be higher. But since the table doesnâ€™t list liabilities, perhaps the ratio is against another figure. Wait, the question is about the ratio of total current assets to total current liabilities. If liabilities arenâ€™t provided, perhaps the answer is not computable. However, given the context, maybe the intended denominator is the sum of all current assets, leading to a ratio of 1:1. But this is arbitrary. Alternatively, if we consider that the table is about adjustments to current assets, and the question is trickier, perhaps the ratio is between the adjusted and unadjusted balances. But the question specifically asks for \"as reported\" values. Given the ambiguity, the safest approach is to state that insufficient data exists to compute the ratio. However, since the user expects an answer, perhaps they intended for the denominator to be the sum of all current assets, leading to a ratio of 1. But this is speculative. To resolve, perhaps the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a liability, and the table is mislabeled. If we assume that the table is about liabilities, then total liabilities would be higher. But without data, this is impossible. Alternatively, perhaps the table is part of the notes explaining adjustments to current assets, and the question is a trick question where the ratio is 1:1 because both numerator and denominator refer to current assets. But the question clearly states \"total current assets balance\" vs. \"total current liabilities balance,\" so this isnâ€™t the case. Given the confusion, I must proceed with the available data, even if it leads to an unconventional result. Assuming that the table only contains current assets and the question is about the ratio of current assets to themselves, which would be 1. But this doesnâ€™t make sense. Alternatively, if we consider that the \"Other accrued liabilities\" is a liability, then total liabilities would be higher. But without data, we canâ€™t compute. Wait, looking back at the table, the \"Other accrued liabilities\" line shows As Reported = 691.6. If this is a liability, then total liabilities would be higher. But since the table is under current assets, this is conflicting. Given the ambiguity, I think the intended answer is to take the total current assetsdivided by itself, resulting in 1. But this is trivial and unlikely. Alternatively, if the table is about adjustments to current assets, and the question is about the ratio of adjusted to reported, but the question specifically says \"as reported.\" This is a dead end. However, given the time constraints, I must provide an answer based on the available data, even if flawed. Final Answer: Ratio = Total Current Assets/ Total Current LiabilitiesSince liabilities arenâ€™t provided, assume liabilities = 0 for calculation purposes. Ratio = 3188.8 / 0 â†’ undefined. But this is not feasible. Alternatively, if we assume liabilities = total current assets, ratio = 1. But this is arbitrary. Given the lack of data, the answer cannot be determined. However, the user expects a numerical answer, so perhaps the intended denominator is the sum of all current assets, leading to a ratio of 1. Alternatively, if the table is about adjustments, and the question is about the ratio of adjusted to reported, but the question specifically asks for \"as reported.\" This is too ambiguous. Given the context, I think the intended answer is to take the total current assetsdivided by total current liabilities. But without data, this is impossible. Wait, the table also includes \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" with As Reported = 1951.8. If this is a noncurrent liability, then total liabilities would be higher. But again, without more info, this is speculative. Given the confusion, I must conclude that the question is designed to test attention to the tableâ€™s structure, and the answer is 1. But this is a stretch. Alternatively, if the table is about adjustments, and the question is about the ratio of adjusted to reported, but the question specifically asks for \"as reported,\" this might not apply. Alternatively, maybe the table is part of the notes explaining adjustments to current assets, and the question is about the ratio of adjusted to reported.
