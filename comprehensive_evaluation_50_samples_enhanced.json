From the context provided, there's a mention that deferred income taxes show the net effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax purposes.

Deferred taxes arise when there are differences between how a company accounts for assets and liabilities under GAAP versus how they're treated for tax purposes. These differences can create temporary differences where future taxable amounts differ from current accounting values. So, deferred income taxes would represent these net effects. Specifically, they account for the timing differences between recognizing revenue or expenses for tax and accounting purposes. For example, if a company recognizes revenue in its financial statements before paying。",
