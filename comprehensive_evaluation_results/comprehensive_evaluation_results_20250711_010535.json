The formula for the number of permutations ofdistinct objects is given by, which stands for the factorial of. Here,, so we need to compute. Let's break it down step by step: Understanding Factorial:means multiplying all positive integers from 1 up to 5. Mathematically, this is expressed as: [ 5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 ] Calculating Step-by-Step: Start with 5:Multiply by 4:Multiply by 3:Multiply by 2:Finally, multiply by 1:So, after performing the multiplication, we find that. ### Verification via Combinatorial Reasoning: Another way to confirm this result is through combinatorial reasoning. For the first book, there are 5 choices. Once placed, there are 4 remaining choices for the second book, then 3 for the third, 2 for the fourth, and 1 for the fifth. Multiplying these together gives the total arrangements: [ 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120 ] This matches our previous calculation. ### Conclusion: The number of different ways to arrange 5 distinct books on a shelf is.",
