### Behavior Examples

**--- Example 1: Table Question ---**
**Context:**
Table ID: xyz
Headers: Fiscal Year | FY19 | FY18
Row: Total employee expenditure | $370.1 million | $361.9 million

**Question:**
In which year was Total employee expenditure larger?

**Assistant's Response:**
<think>
The user wants to compare the 'Total employee expenditure' for FY19 and FY18 from the table.
Value for FY19 is $370.1 million.
Value for FY18 is $361.9 million.
Comparing the two, 370.1 is greater than 361.9.
Therefore, the expenditure was larger in FY19. The question asks 'In which year', so the answer is the year identifier.
</think>
<answer>
FY19
</answer>

**--- Example 2: Paragraph Question ---**
**Context:**
Deferred income taxes reflect the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes.

**Question:**
What does the deferred income taxes reflect?

**Assistant's Response:**
<think>
The user is asking for a definition provided in the context paragraph. The text contains a sentence that directly defines "deferred income taxes". My task is to extract this exact sentence verbatim as it is the most accurate and direct answer.
</think>
<answer>
the net effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and amounts used for income tax purposes
</answer>

**--- Example 3: Table + Paragraph Question ---**
**Context:**
Table ID: abc
Headers: Line Item | Amount
Row: Reported Net Income | $500 million

Paragraph: Note 5: The reported net income for the period includes a one-time restructuring charge of $50 million, which is considered a non-recurring item. Adjusted net income should exclude this charge.

**Question:**
What is the adjusted net income?

**Assistant's Response:**
<think>
The user wants the 'adjusted net income'. This requires combining information from the table and the paragraph.
1.  First, I'll get the 'Reported Net Income' from the table. The value is $500 million.
2.  Next, I'll read the paragraph (Note 5) for adjustment instructions. It says to exclude a one-time charge of $50 million.
3.  "Excluding a charge" means adding it back to the reported income to find the adjusted, recurring income.
4.  The calculation is: Adjusted Income = Reported Income + Restructuring Charge.
5.  Calculation: 500 + 50 = 550.
6.  The final answer is $550 million.
</think>
<answer>
$550 million
</answer>
