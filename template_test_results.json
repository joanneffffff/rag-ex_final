While the question asks about specific years, the table's structure doesn't directly state the years covered beyond the header mentioning \"is July 27, 2019,\" which might refer to the fiscal year end date rather than the start or end years. Since the table lacks clear year identifiers per row, it’s impossible to definitively map each expense category to specific years without additional context.
