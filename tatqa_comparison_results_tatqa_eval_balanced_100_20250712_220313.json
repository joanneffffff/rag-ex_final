        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking about the balances of inventories and other accrued liabilities without adopting Topic 606. They provided a table with various line items, including receivables, inventories, prepaid expenses, and other accrued liabilities.\n\nFirst, I need to identify which rows correspond to inventories and other accrued liabilities. From the headers, it looks like each row has \"Current assets\" and then under that, different categories. Wait, the first entry is Receivables, but the user wants inventories. Let me check the lines again.\n\nLooking at the data:\n\n- Inventories: As Reported is $1,571.7 million, Adjustments is ($3.1), so Balances without Adoption is $1,568.6 million. That seems straightforward.\n\nThen, for other accrued liabilities, the category is listed under Current liabilities. The line says Other accrued liabilities: As Reported is $691.6 million, Adjustments is ($1.1), so Balances without Adoption would be $690.5 million. \n\nWait, the user mentioned \"other accrued liabilities,\" so that's the one under Current liabilities. But I should make sure there aren't any other entries. The other noncurrent liabilities are also listed, but those are noncurrent, so they're not relevant here. \n\nSo the answer should have two numbers: inventories balance without adoption is $1,568.6 million, and other accrued liabilities is $690.5 million. Let me double-check the adjustments. For inventories, As Reported minus Adjustment (since adjustment is negative) gives 1,571.7 - (-3.1) = 1,571.7 + 3.1 = 1,574.8? Wait no, wait. Wait the adjustment is ($3.1 million). So if the As Reported is 1,571.7, and the adjustment is subtracted, meaning the Balance without Adoption is As Reported plus Adjustments? Or is the adjustment applied to the As Reported?\n\nThe way these tables usually work is that the \"Adjustments\" column shows the changes needed to adjust the As Reported amount to get the Balances without Adoption. So if the adjustment is negative, you subtract it from As Reported. Wait, but looking at the example given for Receivables: As Reported is $831.7, Adjustments is $8.7,",
