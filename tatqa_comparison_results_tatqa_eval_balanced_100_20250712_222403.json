The key row in the table is \"Balance at end of period,\" which shows values over multiple years. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- For the year ending December 31, 2019, the Balance at end of period is listed as 32,472,406 (Value column). This value is in thousands, so converting it to actual dollars would be 32,472,406 * 1,000 = $32,472,406,000. However, since the question asks about exceeding $30 million, we can directly compare the given values without conversion because they are already in the same units (thousands).\n\nThe table includes entries for different years, but the specific years aren't labeled explicitly. However, the \"As of December 31\" dates in the rows indicate the fiscal years. The first row after the header mentions \"As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me parse this again carefully.\n\nWait, looking back at the table context:\n\nRow 1 data: As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\n\nThis might be a formatting error. It's possible that the table has headers misaligned. Let me re-express the table structure based on the provided data:\n\nAssuming the table has three columns: the first column is the description, the second is \"As of December 31,\" and the third is the corresponding value. But the way it's presented here is confusing. Let me try to reconstruct the table properly.\n\nFrom the text context, there's a table with the following rows:\n\n1. Row 1: As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018. This seems like a header row indicating the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, with a value of 2018 (probably in thousands).\n2.

To find the cost of internally-developed software in 2019, we need to consider the difference between these two amounts. \n\nFirst, calculate the decrease in capitalized costs from 2018 to 2019:\n$7.7 million (2018) - $6.5 million (2019) = $1.2 million decrease.\n\nSince the R&D expense increased by $8.7 million in 2019 compared to 2018, but part of this increase ($1.2 million) is attributed to changes in capitalized software costs, the actual cost of internally-developed software would be the difference between the two years' capitalized amounts. However, the question asks for the \"cost\" of internally-developed software in 2019. Typically, capitalized software costs represent the asset on the balance sheet, not the expense recognized in the income statement. But according to the text, the increase in R&D expense included an increase due to capitalized software costs. \n\nWait, the text says: \"...resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.\" So the $8.7 million increase in R&D expense had a component of $1.2 million due to capitalized software costs. Therefore, the 2019 capitalized amount ($6.5M) represents the portion of software costs capitalized as assets, not expensed. However, the question is about the \"cost\" of internally-developed software in 2019. If they're asking for the expense recognized (not capitalized), then perhaps the answer is the difference between the two years' capitalized amounts plus other components. Wait, but the text mentions that the increase in expense was partly due to capitalized software costs. Let me parse this again.\n\nThe text says: \"In addition, a total of $6.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2019 and $7.7 million of internally-developed software costs during 2018 were capitalized, resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.\"\n\nSo, the capitalized amounts are $6.5M (2019) vs. $7.7",

However, the question specifically mentions \"Charges included in discontinued operations,\" and the table shows that for 2019 and 2018, the value is 2014, while 2017 is 2.4. Given that the question is asking for the year with such charges, both 2019 and 2018 would technically have charges if ignoring the possible data entry error. But since the user might be referring to the presence of non-zero charges, all three years except 2017 have entries. However, the answer likely expects the year where the charge was included, which is every year except 2017. But given the way the question is phrased, perhaps they want the earliest year with charges, which would be 2017. Wait, no—the table shows 2017 as 2.4, which is non-zero. So all three years have charges, but the question might be trickier. Wait, looking back: The table lists \"Charges included in discontinued operations\" as 2019: 2014, 2018: 2014, 2017: 2.4. So 2019, 2018, and 2017 all have charges, but 2019 and 2018 have 2014, which is probably a mistake (maybe it should be another number like 14.3?), but according to the table, those are the values. Therefore, the answer would be that charges were included in discontinued operations for all three years listed, but the question might be seeking the year where the",

Specifically, the cost of sales directly incorporates the costs of these materials, so changes in their prices will affect the total cost of goods sold. Gross margin, which is calculated as (Revenue - Cost of Sales) / Revenue, would consequently vary depending on the volatility of raw material costs. For example, if raw material prices rise, the cost of sales increases, leading to a lower gross margin unless revenue also rises proportionally. Conversely, decreasing raw material costs could improve gross margin. The data provided includes purchases of 172 million pounds of copper, 122,000 troy ounces of gold, and 2.6 million troy ounces of silver in fiscal 2019, along with their respective average prices.

The user is asking for the percentage of capital expenditures for Bell Wireline out of the total BCE capital expenditures in 2019. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data points from the provided table. Let me look through the table again. The table has several rows, each corresponding to different segments like Bell Wireless, Bell Wireline, Bell Media, and BCE itself. \n\nLooking at the rows:\n- For Bell Wireline, the 2019 value under \"2019\" column is 3183. This should represent the capital expenditure amount for Bell Wireline in 2019.\n- For BCE as a whole, the 2019 value is 3988. This would be the total capital expenditures for BCE in 2019.\n\nThe question is asking what percentage Bell Wireline's expenditures are of the total BCE expenditures. So the formula here would be:\n\n(Bell Wireline 2019 Expenditures / BCE 2019 Expenditures) * 100\n\nPlugging in the numbers:\n(3183 / 3988) * 100\n\nLet me compute that. First, divide 3183 by 3988. Let me do that division. \n\n3183 ÷ 3988 ≈ 0.798 (since 3988 × 0.8 = 3190.4, which is slightly higher than 3183). So approximately 0.798, which is 79.8%. Wait, but wait, let me check more precisely.\n\nCalculating 3183 divided by 3988:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by 1000 to eliminate decimals: 3183/3988 = ?\n\nLet me use long division. 3988 goes into 3183 how many times? Since 3988 is larger than 3183, it's less than 1. So 0.798... Let me compute 3988 × 0.798 = ?\n\n0.7 × 3988 = 2791.6  \n0.09 × 3988 = 358.92  \n",

The user is asking for the difference in the gross carrying value between Trade Names and Non-Compete Agreements. \n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table. Let me look through the table context again. The table has entries for different categories under \"Other intangible assets\". Specifically, there's a row for \"Trade names\" with a gross carrying value of 1.4 million USD, and another row for \"Non-compete agreements\" with a gross carrying value of 0.9 million USD. \n\nWait, the question is about the difference between these two values. So, I just subtract the smaller number from the larger one. That would be 1.4 minus 0.9, which equals 0.5 million USD. But wait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't mix up the numbers. \n\nLooking back at the table:\n\n- Trade names: Gross carrying value is 1.4\n- Non-compete agreements: Gross carrying value is 0.9\n\nYes, so 1.4 minus 0.9 is indeed 0.5. Therefore, the difference should be $0.5 million. \n\nI should also confirm that these are the correct categories. The text mentions \"Trade names\" and \"Non-compete agreements\" as separate line items, so no confusion there.

The user provided both table and text contexts, but they seem identical here. Let me check the details.\n\nFrom the context given, his salary went from $390,000 to $440,000. To find the percentage increase, I need to calculate the difference between the new and old salary, divide by the old salary, then multiply by 100. \n\nSo the difference is 440,000 minus 390,000, which is 50,000. Then, 50,000 divided by 390,000 equals approximately 0.1282. Multiplying by 100 gives 12.82%. Let me confirm the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the values. Yes, original is 390k, new is 440k. The calculation seems right. So the percentage increase should be around 12.82%, which rounds to 12.8% or maybe 12.82% depending on required decimal places.

The user is asking for the cost of internally-developed software in 2019. \n\nFirst, I'll look at the Table Context and Text Context provided. Both paragraphs mention the same information. The key part here is where they talk about internally-developed software costs. \n\nIn the text, it says: \"a total of $6.5 million of internally-developed software costs during 2019 and $7.7 million of internally-developed software costs during 2018 were capitalized, resulting in an increase of the expense by $1.2 million compared to 2018.\"\n\nSo, the figure for 2019 is directly given as $6.5 million. The rest of the information about the increase in R&D expenses is due to other factors like employee costs, hosting, and office expenses. The $1.2 million increase in expense is from the difference between the 2019 and 2018 capitalized amounts ($6.5M - $7.7M = -$1.2M, but since it's an increase in expense, maybe the accounting treatment capitalizes some and expenses the rest? Wait, but the wording says that the $6.5M and $7.7M were capitalized, leading to an increase in expense. Hmm, perhaps the amount capitalized affects the expense. If they capitalize more in 2019, then the expense would be less? Or maybe the non-capitalized portion is what's included in the expense. But the question is specifically about the cost of internally-developed software in 2019, which is stated as $6.5 million. \n\nI need to make sure there's no confusion here. The text clearly states that during 2019, $6.5 million were capitalized. So the answer should be $6.5 million. The rest of the details about the R&D expense increase are not relevant to the specific question. Therefore, the correct answer is $6.5 million.\n</think>\n\n<answer>$6.5 million</answer>",

The user wants the percentage change in net cash from operating activities from 2017 to 2018. \n\nFirst, I need to find the values for those years. Looking at the table context, under \"Net cash from operating activities,\" the numbers are given as 2019: 1066, 2018: 1058, 2017: 1310. Wait, but the question is from 2017 to 2018, so that's 2017 to 2018. But wait, the data shows 2017 is 1310, 2018 is 1058. So the change is from 1310 to 1058.\n\nBut wait, the user might have confused the years? Let me check again. The question says from 2017 to 2018. So 2017 is the base year, 2018 is the next year. So the formula for percentage change is ((New Value - Old Value)/Old Value)*100. Here, New Value is 2018's value (1058), Old Value is 2017's (1310). \n\nCalculating that: (1058 - 1310)/1310 * 100. Let me compute that. 1058 minus 1310 is -252. Then divide by 1310: -252/1310 ≈ -0.19236... Multiply by 100 gives approximately -19.236%. So about a 19.24% decrease. \n\nWait, but the paragraph mentions that cash flows from operations were 1,066 million in 2019, 1,058 in 2018, and 1,310 in 2017. So the numbers match the table. Therefore, the calculation is correct. The percentage change is negative, indicating a decrease. The answer should be -19.24%, but maybe rounded to two decimal places.

Looking at the Table Context, there's a row for \"Total Net Sales.\" The values mentioned are 85034000 for 2019, 77651000 for 2018, and 73948000 for 2017. Wait, but the question is about 2018 to 2019, so the relevant numbers should be 2019 and 2018.\n\nSo, the formula for percentage change is [(New Value - Old Value)/Old Value] * 100. Here, New Value is 2019's Total Net Sales (85,034,000) and Old Value is 2018's (77,651,000). \n\nCalculating the difference: 85,034,000 - 77,651,000 = 7,383,000. Then divide by 77,651,000: 7,383,000 / 77,651,000 ≈ 0.09507. Multiply by 100 gives approximately 9.507%. Rounding to two decimal places, that's 9.51%.\n\nWait, but let me double-check the numbers. The Total Net Sales for 2019 is 85,034,000 and 2018 is 77,651,000. Yes, that's right. So the calculation seems correct. The answer should be a 9.51% increase.\n</think>\n\n<answer>9.51%</answer>",

The user is asking, \"How much were software in 2019?\" So I need to find the value of software for the year 2019 from the given table and text context.\n\nFirst, looking at the Table Context. The table has various categories, and one of them is \"For Software.\" The row for Software shows that on February 28, the value is 31349. But wait, the date here might be important. The first row mentions February 28, is 2019, Value is 2018. That seems like maybe the dates are a bit confusing. Wait, perhaps the dates refer to the balance sheet date?

The entry says \"For Software: February 28, is 31349, Value is 31427.\" Wait, but the numbers here are in thousands of USD. However, the question is about the amount in 2019.

For example, the row with \"For Less accumulated depreciation and amortization\" has a negative number, which probably relates to the total. Then there's Row 8 data with 79828 as the value, but that's under the category of Less accumulated depreciation and amortization. \n\nWait, maybe the main thing is that the Software line has a value of 31349. But the problem is whether that's the value for 2019. The first row says February 28, is 2019, Value is 2018. Maybe that's indicating that the date is February 28, 2019, and the Value column refers to something else. But the Software row's value is 31349. Since all values are in thousands of USD, the actual amount would be 31,349 thousand dollars, which is $31,349,000. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the 'Value' column refers to the previous year's value?

        "raw_generated_text": "<think>\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking for the difference in the gross carrying value between Trade Names and Non-compete agreements.\n\nFirst, I need to locate the relevant data in the provided table context. The table lists various categories with their Gross carrying values. Let me scan through the entries.\n\nUnder the category \"Trade names,\" the Gross carrying value is 1.4 million USD. Then, for \"Non-compete agreements,\" it's 0.9 million USD. Wait, but I should check if there's a total or if these are separate. The table also mentions \"Other intangible assets\" with a Gross carrying value of 21.4, but that's probably the sum of all the individual categories. However, the question specifically asks about Trade Names and Non-compete agreements, so those two entries are directly relevant.\n\nSo, the Gross carrying value for Trade Names is 1.4 and for Non-compete agreements is 0.9. To find the difference, subtract the smaller value from the larger one. That would be 1.4 - 0.9 = 0.5. Therefore, the difference is 0.5 million USD. \n\nWait, but I need to make sure there isn't any other entry that might have been missed. Let me double-check the table. The entries listed are Computer software (9.4), Client relationships (19.1), Trade names (1.4), Non-compete agreements (0.9), Other intangible assets (21.4), and Total (30.8). Adding up the individual categories: 9.4 + 19.1 + 1.4 + 0.9 + 21.4 equals 52.2? Wait, that doesn't match the total of 30.8. Hmm, maybe the \"Other intangible assets\" includes some of the others? Or perhaps the breakdown is different. But the question is only about Trade Names and Non-compete agreements, which are explicitly listed as 1.4 and 0.9 respectively. So regardless of the total, the difference between those two is 0.5. \n\nYes, that seems correct. The answer should be 0.5 million USD.\n</think>\n\n<answer>0.5</answer>",
