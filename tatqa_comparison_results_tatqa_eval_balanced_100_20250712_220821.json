The key row in the table is \"Balance at end of period,\" which shows values over multiple years. \n\nLooking at the table:\n- For the year ending December 31, 2019, the Balance at end of period is listed as 32,472,406 (Value column). This value is in thousands, so converting it to actual dollars would be 32,472,406 * 1,000 = $32,472,406,000. However, since the question asks about exceeding $30 million, we can directly compare the given values without conversion because they are already in the same units (thousands).\n\nThe table includes entries for different years, but the specific years aren't labeled explicitly. However, the \"As of December 31\" dates in the rows indicate the fiscal years. The first row after the header mentions \"As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\" Wait, that seems conflicting. Let me parse this again carefully.\n\nWait, looking back at the table context:\n\nRow 1 data: As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018.\n\nThis might be a formatting error. It's possible that the table has headers misaligned. Let me re-express the table structure based on the provided data:\n\nAssuming the table has three columns: the first column is the description, the second is \"As of December 31,\" and the third is the corresponding value. But the way it's presented here is confusing. Let me try to reconstruct the table properly.\n\nFrom the text context, there's a table with the following rows:\n\n1. Row 1: As of December 31, is 2019, Value is 2018. This seems like a header row indicating the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, with a value of 2018 (probably in thousands).\n2. Next rows describe components contributing to the balance:\n   - Balance at beginning of the year: 32,750,727 (value) for 2019?\n   -",

The user provided both table and text contexts, but they seem identical here. Let me check the details.\n\nFrom the context given, his salary went from $390,000 to $440,000. To find the percentage increase, I need to calculate the difference between the new and old salary, divide by the old salary, then multiply by 100. \n\nSo the difference is 440,000 minus 390,000, which is 50,000. Then, 50,000 divided by 390,000 equals approximately 0.1282. Multiplying by 100 gives 12.82%. Let me confirm the numbers again to make sure I didn't mix up the values. Yes, original is 390k, new is 440k. The calculation seems right. So the percentage increase should be around 12.82%, which rounds to 12.8% or maybe 12.82% depending on required decimal places.
