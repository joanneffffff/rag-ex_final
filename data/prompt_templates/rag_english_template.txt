### Behavior Examples

**--- Example 1: Table Question (Calculation) ---**
**Context:**
Table ID: fd8986104138ada3f444bc670a38f947
Headers: Payments Due by Period
Row: Operating lease obligations (1) | Total is $167.1 million USD
Row: Other purchase obligations and commitments (3) | Total is $205.6 million USD

**Question:**
What was the difference in the total between operating lease obligations and Other purchase obligations and commitments?

**Assistant's Response:**
<think>
The user wants the difference between two values from the table.
1. Find the total for 'Other purchase obligations and commitments'. The value is $205.6 million.
2. Find the total for 'Operating lease obligations'. The value is $167.1 million.
3. Calculate the difference: 205.6 - 167.1 = 38.5.
4. The final answer is a number. I will provide it directly.
</think>
<answer>
38.5
</answer>

**--- Example 2: Paragraph Question (Verbatim Extraction) ---**
**Context:**
Diluted earnings per share are computed by dividing net income, attributable to OpenText, by the shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share plus the dilutive effect of Common Share equivalents, such as stock options, using the treasury stock method.

**Question:**
How is Diluted earnings per share computed?

**Assistant's Response:**
<think>
The user is asking for a definition from the context paragraph. The text contains a long, precise sentence that directly defines the computation method. My task is to extract this exact sentence verbatim to ensure accuracy, as summarizing it might lose critical details.
</think>
<answer>
dividing net income, attributable to OpenText, by the shares used in the calculation of basic earnings per share plus the dilutive effect of Common Share equivalents, such as stock options, using the treasury stock method
</answer>

**--- Example 3: Table + Paragraph Question (Hybrid Reasoning) ---**
**Context:**
Table ID: abc
Headers: Line Item | Amount
Row: Reported Net Income | $500 million

Paragraph: Note 5: The reported net income for the period includes a one-time restructuring charge of $50 million, which is considered a non-recurring item. Adjusted net income should exclude this charge.

**Question:**
What is the adjusted net income?

**Assistant's Response:**
<think>
The user wants the 'adjusted net income'. This requires combining information from the table and the paragraph.
1. First, I get the 'Reported Net Income' from the table. The value is $500 million.
2. Next, I read the paragraph (Note 5) for adjustment instructions. It says to exclude a one-time charge of $50 million.
3. "Excluding a charge" in the context of calculating adjusted income means adding it back to the reported income.
4. The calculation is: Adjusted Income = Reported Income + Restructuring Charge.
5. Calculation: 500 + 50 = 550.
6. The final answer is $550 million.
</think>
<answer>
$550 million
