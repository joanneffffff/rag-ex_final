**CRITICAL RULES for the <answer> tag (READ CAREFULLY & STRICTLY FOLLOW THESE!):**
The content inside the <answer> tag MUST be the most direct and concise answer possible, based ONLY on the provided context. Any deviation will result in an incorrect assessment.

- If the question asks for a **raw numerical value** (e.g., a count, a ratio without explicit units), provide **ONLY the numerical value**.
    - Example (Q: "What is the count?", A: "500")
    - Example (Q: "What is the ratio?", A: "2.5")
    - **DO NOT** include currency symbols ($, £), unit words ("million", "billion", "USD", "EUR"), or any descriptive text.
    - **DO NOT** use commas (e.g., "12345" NOT "12,345").
    - For negative numbers, use a leading minus sign (e.g., "-33" NOT "(33)").

- If the question asks for a **percentage**, provide **ONLY the number followed immediately by a percent sign**.
    - Example (Q: "What is the profit margin?", A: "15.2%")
    - **DO NOT** include the word "percent" or any other text.

- If the question asks for a **currency amount**, provide **ONLY the numerical value**.
    - Example (Q: "What was the revenue?", A: "120.5") for "$120.5 million".
    - **DO NOT** include currency symbols ($, £), currency words ("million", "billion"), or unit words ("USD", "EUR", "m", "b").

- If the question asks for a **specific name, method, or precise phrase**, provide **ONLY the exact phrase or name**.
    - Example (Q: "Under which method?", A: "modified retrospective method")

- **ONLY use a complete sentence** if the question explicitly asks for a definition or explanation that is naturally a full sentence extracted **verbatim** from the text. This applies to factual/descriptive questions.

- **ABSOLUTELY NO** introductory phrases ("The answer is...", "It is...", "The value is...", "Therefore...", "So..."), explanations, derivations, internal thoughts, or conversational filler **outside the <answer> tag.**

# Example 2: Paragraph - Method Extraction (Simple Textual)
Q: What method did the company use when Topic 606 in fiscal 2019 was adopted?
Table Context: 
Text Context: We utilized a comprehensive approach to evaluate and document the impact of the guidance on our current accounting policies and practices in order to identify material differences, if any, that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. We did not identify any material differences resulting from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts. In addition, we did not identify any significant changes to our business processes, systems, and controls to support recognition and disclosure requirements under the new guidance. We adopted the provisions of Topic 606 in fiscal 2019 utilizing the modified retrospective method. We recorded a $0.5 million cumulative effect adjustment, net of tax, to the opening balance of fiscal 2019 retained earnings, a decrease to receivables of $7.6 million, an increase to inventories of $2.8 million, an increase to prepaid expenses and other current assets of $6.9 million, an increase to other accrued liabilities of $1.4 million, and an increase to other noncurrent liabilities of $0.2 million. The adjustments primarily related to the timing of recognition of certain customer charges, trade promotional expenditures, and volume discounts.

# Example 4: Paragraph - Numerical Extraction (Complex Phrase)
Q: What is the net change in the total valuation allowance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019?
Table Context: 
Text Context: In assessing the realization of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that a portion of the net deferred assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Based on the available objective evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019 will not be realizable. Accordingly, management has maintained a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets at December 31, 2019. The net change in the total valuation allowance for the 12 months ended December 31, 2019 was an increase of $1,816.
