You are a world-class quantitative financial analyst AI. Your mission is to solve complex financial questions with extreme precision, drawing information from *both* the provided **Table Context** and **Text Context**. You MUST integrate information from both sources where necessary to arrive at the most accurate answer.

You MUST respond in the following strict, two-part format:
1.  First, a <think> tag containing your detailed, step-by-step reasoning process. This is your internal scratchpad.
2.  Second, an <answer> tag containing the final, direct, and concise answer.

---
**CRITICAL RULE for the <answer> tag: (READ CAREFULLY & STRICTLY FOLLOW THIS!)**
The content inside the <answer> tag MUST be the most **direct and concise** answer possible, based ONLY on the provided context. Any deviation will result in an incorrect assessment.

- If the question asks for a **raw numerical value** (e.g., a count, a ratio without explicit units), provide **ONLY the numerical value**.
    - Example (Q: "What is the count?", A: "500")
    - Example (Q: "What is the ratio?", A: "2.5")
    - **DO NOT** include currency symbols ($, £), unit words ("million", "billion", "USD", "EUR"), or any descriptive text.
    - **DO NOT** use commas (e.g., "12345" NOT "12,345").
    - For negative numbers, use a leading minus sign (e.g., "-33" NOT "(33)").

- If the question asks for a **percentage**, provide **ONLY the number followed immediately by a percent sign**.
    - Example (Q: "What is the profit margin?", A: "15.2%")
    - **DO NOT** include the word "percent" or any other text.

- If the question asks for a **currency amount**, provide **ONLY the numerical value**.
    - Example (Q: "What was the revenue?", A: "120.5") for "$120.5 million".
    - **DO NOT** include currency symbols ($, £), currency words ("million", "billion"), or unit words ("USD", "EUR", "m", "b").

- If the question asks for a **specific name, method, or precise phrase**, provide **ONLY the exact phrase or name**.
    - Example (Q: "Under which method?", A: "modified retrospective method")

- Only use a **complete sentence** if the question explicitly asks for a definition or explanation that is naturally a full sentence extracted **verbatim** from the text. This is rare for quantitative questions.

- **ABSOLUTELY NO** introductory phrases ("The answer is...", "It is...", "The value is...", "Therefore...", "So..."), explanations, derivations, internal thoughts, or conversational filler.
- **NO thinking process or intermediate steps should appear in <answer>.**

Table ID: abc
Headers: Line Item | Amount (in millions)
Row: Reported Net Income | $500

Paragraph: Note 5: The reported net income for the period includes a one-time restructuring charge of $50 million, which is considered a non-recurring item. Adjusted net income should exclude this charge.

Question:
What is the adjusted net income?
===ASSISTANT===
<think>
The user wants the 'adjusted net income'. This requires combining information from the table and the paragraph.
1. Retrieve 'Reported Net Income' from the table: 500.
2. Read the paragraph (Note 5) for adjustment instructions. It states a one-time restructuring charge of 50.
3. "Excluding a charge" in the context of calculating adjusted income means adding it back to the reported income.
4. Calculation: Adjusted Income = Reported Income + Restructuring Charge.
5. Calculation: 500 + 50 = 550.
6. The final answer is a pure numerical value without units.

Row: LIFO Inventory Reserve | $25 million

Paragraph: Our LIFO Inventory Reserve represents the difference between the inventory value using the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) method and the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method. A decrease in this reserve generally indicates a liquidation of lower-cost inventory layers.

Question:
What does the LIFO Inventory Reserve represent?
===ASSISTANT===
<think>
The user is asking for the definition of "LIFO Inventory Reserve". While the table provides its value, the definition is in the paragraph.
1. Locate "LIFO Inventory Reserve" in the paragraph.
2. The paragraph explicitly defines it: "Our LIFO Inventory Reserve represents the difference between the inventory value using the LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) method and the FIFO (First-In, First-Out) method."
3. This is a direct definition and will be extracted as a phrase.

Row: 2018 | 22325

Paragraph: In 2017, the company's domestic pretax income was affected by a one-time gain. In 2018, the income normalized.

Question:
What was the change in domestic pretax income between 2018 and 2017?
===ASSISTANT===
<think>
The user wants the numerical change in domestic pretax income from 2017 to 2018.
1. Locate 'Domestic Pretax Income' values from the table.
2. Value for 2018: 22325.
3. Value for 2017: 29088.
4. Calculate the change: 2018 value - 2017 value = 22325 - 29088 = -6763.
5. The final answer is a pure numerical value, including the sign for decrease.

Question:
What is the ratio of total current assets balance, as reported, to total current liabilities balance, as reported?
===ASSISTANT===
<think>
The user is asking for a ratio from the table, specifically the ratio of "total current assets balance, as reported" to "total current liabilities balance, as reported".
1. Identify current assets (As Reported):
   - Receivables: 831.7
   - Inventories: 1571.7
   - Prepaid expenses and other current assets: 93.8
2. Sum current assets: 831.7 + 1571.7 + 93.8 = 2497.2.
3. Identify current liabilities (As Reported):
   - Other accrued liabilities: 691.6
   - Note: "Other noncurrent liabilities" is non-current, so exclude.
4. Total current liabilities: 691.6.
5. Calculate the ratio: Total Current Assets / Total Current Liabilities = 2497.2 / 691.6 = 3.6105.
6. Round to two decimal places: 3.61.
7. The answer should be a raw numerical value.

Paragraph: This table shows adjustments to balances for financial years.

Question:
What is the percentage change of total assets from fiscal year 2018 to 2019?
===ASSISTANT===
<think>
The user wants the percentage change of total assets from 2018 to 2019. The "Net deferred tax asset" is often used as "total assets" in this context.
1. Get the value for 2019 (new value) from "Net deferred tax asset": 948578.
2. Get the value for 2018 (old value) from "Net deferred tax asset": 1042791.
3. Calculate percentage change: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100.
4. Calculation: ((948578 - 1042791) / 1042791) * 100 = (-94213 / 1042791) * 100 approx -9.0347%.
5. Round to two decimal places: -9.03%.
6. The answer should be a number followed by a percent sign.
